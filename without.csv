"The Bible","Various",100,"Middle East","The Bible by Various written in 100","The Bible, a collection of religious texts, contains a wide range of characters, from historical figures to mythical beings. Evaluating the main characters based on the specified referent, we find a mix of real historical figures, such as kings and prophets, alongside characters whose existence is more symbolic or allegorical, such as Adam and Eve, and supernatural beings like angels and God. Given the context of the time, many characters are presented as real or could have been perceived as real by contemporary audiences, but others, especially those with supernatural attributes, fall into the realm of myth and allegory. Therefore, the main characters in the Bible span a range from real to those that could not have existed. However, considering the overall narrative and the presence of divine and mythical elements, the characters often lean towards the improbable or impossible in terms of existence. Score=3","Evaluating the Bible, particularly focusing on the events described within it, requires considering the standards and context of the time it was written. The Bible is a collection of texts that include historical narratives, poetry, prophecy, and law, among other genres. Some events described in the Bible, such as the reigns of certain kings or battles, have historical corroboration or are plausible within the historical context of the ancient Near East. However, other events, such as the creation story in Genesis, the parting of the Red Sea, or the resurrection of Jesus, are considered by many scholars to be theological or mythological in nature rather than historical.

Given the blend of historical and theological narratives, and considering the standards of the time when these texts were written, many of the events described could be seen as invented historical events whose occurrence is improbable, especially when viewed through a modern historical and scientific lens. Therefore, for the purpose of this evaluation, the events in the Bible can be categorized as invented historical events whose occurrence is improbable.

Score=3","The Bible, as a collection of texts written over centuries, contains a variety of settings that range from real geographical locations to more fantastical ones. Many of the locations mentioned, such as Jerusalem, Egypt, and Babylon, are real geographical places that existed and continue to exist. However, the Bible also includes settings that are more symbolic or mythical in nature, such as the Garden of Eden or the city of Nineveh as described in the story of Jonah, which may include invented details or elements that are not historically verifiable.

Given the context of the time, many of the locations in the Bible were understood to be real or based on real places, even if some details were embellished or symbolic. Therefore, the settings in the Bible often fall into the category of real geographical locations with invented details, reflecting both historical and theological narratives.

These elements suggest that while Gilgamesh may have been a real person, the details of his story are largely fictionalized and mythologized.

While the characters are fictional, they are designed to be plausible within the context of the story, as they represent archetypes that could exist in real life, such as marine biologists or adventurers. However, the situations they find themselves in, and sometimes their exaggerated characteristics, push them slightly towards the improbable side.

Therefore, the events in ""Voyage dans la lune"" fall into the category of invented historical events that could not have occurred. Score=4","""Voyage dans la lune"" by Cyrano de Bergerac is a work of early science fiction that describes a fantastical journey to the moon. In the context of the 17th century, when the work was written, the moon was a mysterious and largely unknown celestial body.

The main characters in the poem are largely based on real historical figures, such as Vasco da Gama and his crew, who were actual Portuguese explorers. However, the poem also includes mythological elements and divine interventions, which were common in epic poetry of the time, drawing from classical traditions. Despite these mythological aspects, the main characters themselves are rooted in historical reality, with some artistic embellishments typical of epic storytelling.

Score=1","""The Lusiads"" by Luís de Camões is an epic poem that primarily recounts the Portuguese voyages of discovery during the Age of Exploration, focusing on Vasco da Gama's pioneering sea route to India. The poem blends historical events with mythological and fantastical elements. 

When evaluating the historical events depicted in ""The Lusiads,"" particularly Vasco da Gama's journey, it is important to consider the standards and context of the 16th century. The poem is based on actual historical events, specifically the real voyage of Vasco da Gama from 1497 to 1499. However, Camões embellishes these events with invented details, such as divine interventions by gods and mythical creatures, which were common literary devices of the time to enhance the narrative.

Given this context, the events in ""The Lusiads"" can be classified as actual historical events with invented details. The core journey and its significance are historically accurate, but the narrative is enriched with fictional elements typical of epic poetry.

Score=1","""The Lusiads"" by Luís de Camões is an epic poem that primarily recounts the voyages of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama and the discovery of the sea route to India.

However, Camões embellishes these real locations with mythological and fantastical elements, such as encounters with gods and mythical creatures, which were common literary devices of the time to enhance the narrative.

Given the context of the 16th century, when exploration was at its peak and the blending of real and mythical elements was a popular literary technique, the settings in ""The Lusiads"" can be seen as real geographical locations with invented details.

The story is filled with exaggerated and fantastical elements, reflecting the Renaissance humanist context in which it was written. The character of Gargantua is an invented one, drawing on folklore and mythological traditions of giants, but his existence is highly improbable given his exaggerated size and capabilities. The narrative uses these fantastical elements to explore themes of education, religion, and society, often in a humorous and critical manner. Considering the standards and context of the 16th century, Gargantua is a character that could not have existed in reality. Score=4","""Gargantua"" by François Rabelais is a satirical and comedic work that features the life and adventures of the giant Gargantua.

Given the context of the 16th century, when the work was written, such fantastical elements were understood as part of the genre of satire and parody, rather than as plausible historical events. Therefore, the events in ""Gargantua"" are invented historical events that could not have occurred, as they involve supernatural and impossible elements. Score=4","""Gargantua"" by François Rabelais is a satirical and comedic work that features a mix of real and fantastical elements.

"Faust","Johann Wolfgang von Goethe",1808,"Germany","Faust by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe written in 1808","In Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's ""Faust,"" the main characters include Faust, Mephistopheles, and Gretchen (Margarete). Faust is a scholar who makes a pact with the devil, Mephistopheles, in exchange for unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures. While Faust is based on the historical figure Johann Georg Faust, a German alchemist and magician, Goethe's portrayal includes significant fictional elements, such as the supernatural pact with Mephistopheles. Mephistopheles, as a devilish figure, is a character rooted in folklore and religious tradition, representing an embodiment of evil and temptation. Gretchen is a character who could plausibly exist as a young woman in Goethe's time, but her involvement in the fantastical elements of the story ties her to the fictional narrative.

Considering the standards and context of the early 19th century, the characters in ""Faust"" are primarily invented with elements that make their existence improbable, especially due to the supernatural and allegorical aspects of the story. Therefore, the main characters in ""Faust"" fall into the category of invented characters whose existence is improbable.

Score=3","In Goethe's ""Faust,"" the specific referent of interest is the pact between Faust and Mephistopheles, where Faust sells his soul to the devil in exchange for unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures. This event is a central element of the narrative and is rooted in the legend of Faust, a character from German folklore. The idea of making a pact with the devil is a common motif in literature and folklore, symbolizing the human struggle with temptation and the quest for knowledge and power. However, such a pact is a supernatural event that could not have occurred in reality, as it involves elements beyond the natural world and human experience.

The main character in this work is often considered to be a poetic persona or voice that reflects on themes such as the nature of life, the passage of time, and the pursuit of happiness. This persona is not a distinct character with a detailed biography but rather a philosophical voice that could represent Khayyam himself or a generalized human experience.

Given the context of the time, the persona in the quatrains could be seen as an invented character who embodies philosophical ideas and reflections that were common in Persian literature. This character could have existed as a representation of a thoughtful individual pondering life's mysteries, which aligns with the cultural and intellectual milieu of the period.

It does not aim to recount historical events but rather to explore existential and metaphysical ideas through poetry.

Given the nature of the work, it does not present historical events in the traditional sense. Instead, it offers philosophical musings and allegorical reflections. Therefore, the aspect of ""events"" as defined in the scale does not directly apply to The Rubaiyat. However, if we consider the philosophical reflections as ""invented historical events"" in a metaphorical sense, they are not meant to be taken as literal occurrences. They are more akin to invented scenarios or allegories that illustrate philosophical points.

The novel is set in both 1930s Moscow and ancient Jerusalem, weaving together these different timelines and characters.

The characters of the Master and Margarita, while deeply human and complex, are invented and could have existed within the context of 1930s Soviet society. However, Woland and his retinue, including characters like the talking cat Behemoth, are fantastical and could not have existed in reality. Given the presence of these supernatural elements and characters whose existence is improbable, the work leans towards the more fantastical end of the scale.

Considering the standards and context of the time, where Soviet literature often included elements of social realism, the presence of such fantastical characters would have been seen as highly imaginative and improbable. Therefore, the main characters in ""The Master and Margarita"" are best categorized as invented characters whose existence is improbable.

When evaluating the historical events depicted in the novel, particularly the trial of Jesus, Bulgakov presents a narrative that is based on actual historical events but includes invented details and interpretations. The trial of Jesus is a well-documented historical event, but Bulgakov's portrayal includes fictionalized elements and characterizations that are not found in historical records. Given the context of the time, where blending historical events with fictional elements was a common literary technique, this aspect of the novel can be classified as actual historical events with invented details. Score=1","""The Master and Margarita"" by Mikhail Bulgakov is set in two primary locations: Moscow and a fantastical version of ancient Jerusalem. The Moscow setting is based on real geographical locations, with Bulgakov incorporating recognizable landmarks and streets from the city as it existed in the 1930s. However, he adds invented details, such as the presence of supernatural events and characters like Woland (the Devil) and his retinue, which blend the real with the fantastical.

The second setting, ancient Jerusalem, is depicted in the narrative of Pontius Pilate. While Jerusalem is a real historical location, Bulgakov's portrayal includes fictionalized elements and interpretations that serve the novel's themes and narrative structure.

Considering the standards and context of the time, the settings in ""The Master and Margarita"" reflect a blend of real locations with invented details, particularly in the Moscow setting, which is grounded in reality but enhanced with fantastical elements.

Score=3","""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins is set in a dystopian future where the nation of Panem is divided into districts, each of which must send tributes to participate in a televised fight to the death known as the Hunger Games. This scenario involves a society that has emerged after a series of unspecified apocalyptic events, leading to a totalitarian regime that uses the Games as a form of control and entertainment.

Evaluating this based on the specified referent of events, the concept of a society organizing annual death matches as a form of entertainment and control is an invented historical event. While it draws on themes of totalitarianism and societal control that have historical precedents, the specific event of the Hunger Games themselves is highly improbable in the context of modern or historical societies. The idea of a government maintaining control through such a spectacle is a fictional exaggeration, though it serves as a powerful allegory for real-world issues.
