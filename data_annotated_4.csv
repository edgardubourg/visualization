"The Bible","Various",100,"Middle East","The Bible by Various written in 100","Evaluating the main protagonists of the Bible, we must consider the worldview and beliefs of people during the historical period in which it was written. The Bible contains a mix of characters, some of whom are considered historical figures, while others are more mythological or symbolic in nature.

1. **Real characters, known or documented to have existed**: Some figures, like certain kings and leaders, are corroborated by historical and archaeological evidence, such as King David and King Solomon. However, the details of their lives as presented in the Bible often include legendary or miraculous elements.

2. **Real characters with invented biographical details**: Many biblical figures, such as Moses and Abraham, are considered by believers to have been real individuals, but their stories include miraculous events and divine interactions that are not historically verifiable.

3. **Invented characters whose existence is probable**: Some characters, like certain prophets or minor figures, may have been based on real individuals, but their specific stories and actions are not documented outside of the biblical texts.

4. **Invented characters whose existence is not probable**: Characters like Job or Jonah, while possibly based on real individuals, are primarily known through narratives that serve theological or moral purposes, making their historical existence less probable.

5. **Invented characters whose existence is not possible because it requires few or soft violations of the laws of the real world**: Figures like Samson, whose strength is attributed to his uncut hair, or Noah, who builds an ark to survive a global flood, involve events that stretch the boundaries of natural law but are not entirely outside the realm of ancient belief systems.

6. **Invented characters whose existence is not possible because it requires frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world**: Characters such as Adam and Eve, who are created directly by God, or angels and demons, require belief in supernatural events and beings that are central to the religious worldview but not possible by natural laws.

Considering the blend of historical, legendary, and mythological elements in the Bible, and the belief systems of the time, the main protagonists often require frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world to exist as described. Therefore, the score is:

Score=5","The Bible, as a collection of texts written over centuries, contains a variety of geographical settings. Many of these locations, such as Jerusalem, Egypt, and Babylon, are real geographical locations known to exist and are well-documented in historical records. However, the Bible also includes places like the Garden of Eden and the Land of Nod, which are more mythical or symbolic in nature. 

Considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the Bible, many of these locations were perceived as real or plausible. For instance, the Garden of Eden was often considered a real place, though its exact location was unknown. The existence of such places was not seen as impossible within the context of the beliefs and knowledge of the time.

Therefore, the Bible's settings range from real locations with historical significance to invented locations that were considered plausible or symbolic within the cultural and religious context of the period. Given this mix, the overall evaluation of the settings in the Bible would be:

Score=1","Evaluating the Bible, particularly focusing on the events described within its texts, requires considering the worldview and beliefs of people during the historical period in which it was written. The Bible contains a mix of historical events, allegorical stories, and theological teachings. 

1. **Actual Historical Events**: Some events, such as the existence of certain historical figures (e.g., some kings of Israel and Judah) and certain battles, have archaeological or historical corroboration. These would fall under category 0 or 1, depending on the level of detail and embellishment.

2. **Invented Historical Events with Probable Occurrence**: Many events, such as migrations or societal changes, could be considered probable given the historical context, even if specific details are not verifiable. These would be category 2.

3. **Invented Historical Events with Improbable Occurrence**: Events like the parting of the Red Sea or the sun standing still during battle are less probable from a historical standpoint but might have been considered possible within the belief systems of the time. These would be category 3.

4. **Invented Historical Events with Impossible Occurrence**: Miraculous events, such as the creation narrative, resurrection, or other supernatural occurrences, require violations of natural laws. These would be considered impossible by modern standards but were often accepted as possible within the ancient worldview. These would fall under category 4 or 5, depending on the frequency and extremity of the violations.

Given the blend of historical, allegorical, and miraculous events, and considering the worldview of the time, the Bible as a whole would likely be assessed as containing events that require frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world, particularly due to its numerous miraculous accounts.

While Gilgamesh is believed to have been a real figure, the epic embellishes his life with numerous mythological elements, such as his divine parentage and his interactions with gods and fantastical creatures. The character of Enkidu, another main protagonist, is entirely invented, created by the gods as a wild man who becomes Gilgamesh's companion. Given the worldview and beliefs of the people in the historical period of the work, the existence of Gilgamesh as a historical figure is probable, but the divine and mythological aspects of his character, as well as the creation of Enkidu, involve elements that are not probable. Therefore, the main protagonists fall into the category of invented characters whose existence is not probable. Score=3","The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian text that features a mix of real and invented locations. The city of Uruk, where much of the story takes place, is a real geographical location known to have existed in ancient Sumer. However, the epic also includes fantastical locations such as the Cedar Forest, which is guarded by the mythical creature Humbaba, and the journey to the ends of the earth to meet Utnapishtim, which involves crossing the Waters of Death. These locations blend real geographical elements with mythological and fantastical details. Given the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, these invented locations were likely seen as possible within the mythological framework of the time, though not probable in a literal sense. Therefore, the settings in The Epic of Gilgamesh can be evaluated as invented locations whose existence is not probable. Score=3","The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian text that blends historical elements with mythological narratives. The story is centered around Gilgamesh, a historical king of Uruk, and includes events such as his friendship with Enkidu, their adventures, and encounters with divine beings. While Gilgamesh himself may have been a real historical figure, the events described in the epic, such as battling mythical creatures like Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven, and the quest for immortality, are rooted in mythology and not documented historical events. 

From the perspective of the people in the historical period of the work, these events were part of their mythological and religious beliefs, making them conceivable within that context. However, they involve interactions with gods and supernatural occurrences, which are not possible according to the laws of the real world. Therefore, the events in the epic require few or soft violations of the natural laws as understood by the people of that time.

The main ""protagonists"" in this context are real historical figures and groups, such as early humans, Homo sapiens, and other hominins. These are real characters known to have existed, as the book is based on anthropological, archaeological, and historical evidence. Harari does not invent biographical details for these figures; rather, he synthesizes existing research to present a narrative of human history. Therefore, the degree of invention is minimal, and the characters are real and documented.

The book primarily discusses real geographical locations and historical events, focusing on the evolution of humans and the development of societies across the globe.

The events described in ""Sapiens"" are based on documented historical and scientific evidence, though Harari sometimes adds interpretative details and theoretical perspectives to provide a broader understanding of human history. These interpretations are grounded in scholarly research and are plausible within the context of the historical periods discussed.

The protagonists are typically scientists, divers, or other professionals dealing with shark-related incidents. These characters are fictional but are crafted to be believable and could plausibly exist in the real world. The films do not require any significant suspension of disbelief regarding the characters themselves, as they are grounded in reality and do not possess any supernatural or extraordinary traits. Therefore, based on the criteria provided, the characters fall into the category of invented characters whose existence is probable. Score=2","The ""Shark Attack"" film series primarily takes place in real-world locations, such as coastal areas and oceans, which are known and documented to exist. However, the series often embellishes these settings with exaggerated or fictionalized details, particularly regarding the behavior and presence of sharks. These embellishments are designed to heighten drama and suspense, but they do not significantly alter the fundamental reality of the geographical locations themselves. Given that the settings are based on real places with some invented details for dramatic effect, the appropriate score for the series, considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the late 20th century, would be:

Score=1","The ""Shark Attack"" film series, starting with the first film directed by Bob Misiorowski in 1999, revolves around the premise of aggressive and often mutated sharks attacking humans. The series typically involves scenarios where sharks exhibit behaviors and abilities that are exaggerated or entirely fictional, such as increased intelligence, unusual aggression, or mutations that give them extraordinary capabilities.

From an anthropological and historical perspective, while shark attacks on humans are real and documented events, the specific scenarios depicted in the films often involve elements that are not probable or possible according to the natural behavior of sharks and the biological laws of the real world. For instance, the idea of sharks being genetically modified to become super-predators or having a vendetta against humans requires a significant departure from known biological and ecological principles.

Considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the late 20th century, when the film was made, the scientific understanding of sharks and their behavior was well-established, and the events depicted in the film would be recognized as fictional and improbable. Therefore, the film's events require frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world, particularly in terms of biology and animal behavior.

Winston is an invented character, but his existence is highly probable within the context of the novel's setting, which is a dystopian future society. The character of Winston Smith is designed to be an everyman, representing the ordinary individual under a totalitarian regime. Given the historical period of the work, the concept of a totalitarian state and the existence of individuals like Winston were conceivable and aligned with the fears and political realities of the time. Therefore, Winston Smith's existence is probable within the worldview and beliefs of people in 1949.

The existence of such a regime and the specific societal conditions described in the novel are not probable, but they do not require violations of the laws of the real world. Instead, they are an exaggerated extension of political and social trends that Orwell observed in his time.

The narrative presents Genji as a nobleman with a detailed and plausible biography, reflecting the customs, politics, and court life of the time. While Genji himself is not a historical figure, the character's existence is probable within the context of the Heian period's aristocratic society.

These characters are largely invented, though they may have been inspired by historical figures or legends. In the context of the 13th-century worldview, the existence of such characters was considered probable due to the blending of myth and history common in epic literature of the time. Siegfried, for example, is a hero with superhuman abilities, such as invulnerability, which would have been seen as plausible within the mythic framework of the period.

However, the poem also includes fantastical elements and mythical places, such as the land of the Nibelungs, which are not real but are presented in a way that could be considered plausible within the context of medieval beliefs and the worldview of the time. The existence of such places would not have required extreme violations of the laws of the real world as understood in the medieval period.

However, the narrative is heavily interwoven with fantastical elements, such as the invincible hero Siegfried, his cloak of invisibility, and the dragon he slays to acquire a treasure hoard. 

From the perspective of people in the historical period of the work, some elements might have been seen as plausible or rooted in historical tradition, while others clearly belong to the realm of legend and myth. The blending of historical figures with fantastical events suggests a narrative that is not bound by strict historical accuracy but rather by the storytelling conventions of the time.

Given the presence of mythical creatures and magical objects, the events in The Nibelungenlied require some violations of the laws of the real world, though not to the extreme degree found in more fantastical works. Therefore, the work can be classified as containing invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible because it requires few or soft violations of the laws of the real world.

Dante, the author, is a real historical figure, and Virgil was a real poet from ancient Rome. However, in the context of the narrative, both characters undertake a journey through the realms of the afterlife—Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso—which involves interactions with various mythological and allegorical figures. 

From the perspective of the 14th-century worldview, the existence of Dante and Virgil as historical figures is real, but their journey through the afterlife is a fictional construct. The narrative requires a belief in the afterlife and the possibility of such a journey, which aligns with the religious and cultural beliefs of the time. However, the specific interactions and the journey itself are not probable in a literal sense, as they involve supernatural elements and allegorical representations.

Therefore, considering the historical context and the nature of the characters' journey, the main protagonists fall under the category of ""Invented characters whose existence is not probable,"" as their journey involves elements that are beyond the natural world but are not entirely impossible within the belief system of the period.

The locations are depicted with vivid and imaginative details that align with the spiritual and moral framework of the era. However, from a geographical and physical standpoint, these realms require significant violations of the natural laws as understood even in the medieval worldview, as they are metaphysical rather than physical places.

The work is deeply rooted in the medieval Christian worldview and reflects the beliefs and theological concepts of the time, such as the existence of an afterlife, divine justice, and the moral structure of the universe.

From the perspective of people in the historical period when Dante wrote the poem, the events described in ""The Divine Comedy"" were not considered actual historical events. Instead, they were allegorical and theological representations of spiritual truths and moral lessons. The journey through the afterlife, encounters with historical and mythological figures, and the detailed descriptions of the various circles of Hell, terraces of Purgatory, and spheres of Heaven are all invented events.

While the existence of an afterlife was a widely held belief, the specific events and structure of the afterlife as depicted by Dante involve imaginative and allegorical elements that go beyond the literal beliefs of the time. Therefore, these events are not considered probable occurrences within the historical context.

Given that the work involves a journey through realms that are not part of the physical world and includes supernatural elements, it requires some violations of the laws of the real world as understood in the medieval period.

1. King Arthur: While there may have been a historical figure or figures that inspired the legend of King Arthur, the character as depicted in Malory's work is heavily fictionalized with numerous legendary and mythical elements.
2. Sir Lancelot: Lancelot is a character primarily from Arthurian romance literature and does not have a historical basis, making his existence improbable.
3. Merlin: As a wizard with magical powers, Merlin's existence is not possible according to the worldview of the time, which did not support the existence of magic as depicted in the tales.

Considering the historical period of the work, the characters are largely seen as legendary and not historical, with elements of magic and myth that were accepted in the context of medieval literature. Therefore, the main protagonists are invented characters whose existence is not probable or possible due to the mythical and magical elements involved.

From the perspective of people in the historical period when Malory wrote the work (the late 15th century), the existence of places like Camelot and Avalon might have been seen as possible or probable within the context of the legendary and mythical framework.

The characters are entirely fictional, yet they are crafted with a high degree of realism and psychological depth. 

Don Quixote is a nobleman who becomes a self-styled knight-errant, driven by his obsession with chivalric romances. His character, while fictional, is plausible within the context of the early 17th century, as he represents a satirical take on the fading ideals of knighthood and the impact of literature on the imagination. Sancho Panza, his loyal squire, is also a fictional character, but his existence is probable as he embodies the common man of the time, providing a counterbalance to Don Quixote's idealism with his practicality and earthy wisdom.

Therefore, the settings do not involve any invented locations or require any violations of the laws of the real world according to the beliefs and worldview of that historical period. 

Score=0","""Don Quixote"" by Miguel de Cervantes is a satirical novel that explores the adventures of a man who believes himself to be a knight-errant. The events in the novel are largely invented and serve to parody the chivalric romances popular during Cervantes' time. While the setting and some social customs reflect the real world of 16th and 17th century Spain, the specific events, such as tilting at windmills and mistaking inns for castles, are exaggerated and improbable within the context of the period's worldview. These events are not possible in the sense that they require a character to consistently misinterpret reality in a way that defies common sense, but they do not involve violations of the physical laws of the real world.

Score=0","""Les Misérables"" by Victor Hugo is a novel set in early 19th-century France, primarily during the years following the Napoleonic Wars and leading up to the June Rebellion of 1832. The work is deeply rooted in the social and political context of the time, and many of the events depicted are based on actual historical occurrences, such as the Battle of Waterloo and the aforementioned June Rebellion. However, Hugo embellishes these events with fictional details and characters to serve his narrative and thematic purposes.

The June Rebellion, for instance, is a real historical event, but the specific actions and outcomes involving the characters in the novel are invented. The novel's depiction of the social conditions, such as poverty and the justice system, reflects real issues of the time, though dramatized for literary effect.

"One Hundred Years of Solitude","Gabriel García Márquez",1967,"Colombia","One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel García Márquez written in 1967","""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" by Gabriel García Márquez is a seminal work of magical realism, a genre that blends the real with the fantastical. The main protagonists of the novel are the members of the Buendía family, whose lives are chronicled over several generations in the fictional town of Macondo. 

The characters in the novel, such as José Arcadio Buendía, Úrsula Iguarán, and their descendants, are entirely invented by the author. While they are portrayed with rich, complex personalities and lifelike details, their existence is not probable in the real world. This is because the novel incorporates elements of magical realism, where fantastical events and characteristics are accepted as part of everyday life. For example, characters experience extraordinary events, such as ascensions to heaven and living for over a century, which are not possible in the real world.

However, these characters are not entirely impossible within the context of the novel's setting and the worldview of the characters themselves. The magical elements are seamlessly integrated into the narrative, reflecting the beliefs and cultural context of the fictional world. Therefore, while the characters are not probable in a realistic sense, they do not require extreme violations of the laws of the real world, as they are consistent with the novel's internal logic and the magical realism genre.

Considering the historical and cultural context of the novel, the characters' existence is not probable but is accepted within the framework of the story's magical realism. Thus, they fall into the category of invented characters whose existence is not probable. 

Score=3","""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" by Gabriel García Márquez is set in the fictional town of Macondo. The town is a central element of the novel and is depicted with a rich blend of magical realism, a style that combines realistic narrative with fantastical elements. Macondo is portrayed as a remote, isolated village in Colombia, which aligns with real geographical locations in Latin America. However, the details of Macondo and its surroundings are heavily invented, incorporating elements that are improbable or impossible according to the laws of the real world, such as the presence of magical events and surreal occurrences.

Considering the historical period of the work, the 20th century, and the worldview of people at that time, the setting of Macondo would be seen as an invented location whose existence is not possible due to the frequent and extreme violations of the laws of the real world, such as the magical occurrences that are integral to the story. Therefore, the setting of Macondo in ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" would be evaluated as:

Score=5","""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" by Gabriel García Márquez is a seminal work of magical realism, a genre that blends fantastical elements with realistic settings and events. The novel chronicles the multi-generational story of the Buendía family in the fictional town of Macondo. While the narrative is deeply rooted in the historical and cultural context of Latin America, it incorporates numerous fantastical events that defy the laws of the real world.

The events in the novel include characters living for over a century, ghosts interacting with the living, and rain lasting for years, among others. These elements are not possible within the framework of the real world, even when considering the beliefs and worldviews of the historical period depicted in the novel. The magical elements are integral to the narrative and are presented as part of the everyday reality of the characters, which is a hallmark of magical realism.

Given the frequent and extreme violations of the laws of the real world required for these events to occur, the work falls into the category of invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible. Therefore, based on the specified scale, the appropriate score for ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" is:

The main protagonist is a fictionalized version of Cyrano himself, who embarks on a fantastical journey to the moon. In the context of the 17th century, the idea of traveling to the moon was purely speculative and imaginative, as it involved concepts and technologies that were not possible at the time. The character's journey involves fantastical elements such as flying machines and encounters with lunar inhabitants, which would have been seen as highly improbable or impossible by the standards of that era. Therefore, the protagonist's existence and experiences require frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world as understood in the 17th century. Score=5","""Voyage dans la lune"" by Cyrano de Bergerac, written in the 17th century, is a work that explores the idea of traveling to the moon. During this period, the moon was a subject of fascination and speculation, but it was not yet understood in the way it is today. The concept of traveling to the moon involved significant imaginative leaps, as the technology and scientific understanding required for such a journey were not available at the time.

In the context of the 17th century, the moon was a real celestial body, but the details of life and landscapes described by Cyrano de Bergerac were entirely invented. The existence of such a location, with its fantastical elements, was not probable according to the scientific knowledge of the time. However, the idea of the moon as a place one could visit did not require extreme violations of the laws of the real world as understood then, since the laws of physics and space travel were not yet fully developed.

Therefore, considering the historical context and the imaginative nature of the setting, the work would be evaluated as an invented location whose existence is not possible because it requires few or soft violations of the laws of the real world as understood in the 17th century.

While the idea of traveling to the moon might have been a topic of curiosity and speculation, the methods and events described in the work involve significant violations of the known laws of physics and technology of the 17th century.

Vasco da Gama was a well-documented explorer from the Age of Discovery, and his journey is a significant historical event. The poem, however, embellishes his story with mythological elements and divine interventions, which were common literary devices of the time. Despite these embellishments, the main protagonist, Vasco da Gama, is a real character known to have existed. Therefore, according to the scale provided, the main protagonist falls under the category of real characters, known or documented to have existed.

However, the poem also includes mythological and fantastical elements, such as the Island of Love, which is an invented location that requires some suspension of disbelief and soft violations of the real world's laws. Given the historical context of the 16th century, when exploration was expanding the known world, the inclusion of such fantastical elements would have been seen as a creative embellishment rather than a literal geographical claim. Therefore, the settings in ""The Lusiads"" can be evaluated as real geographical locations with invented details and some mythological embellishments. Score=1","""The Lusiads"" by Luís de Camões is an epic poem that primarily recounts the Portuguese voyages of discovery during the Age of Exploration, focusing on Vasco da Gama's journey to India.

From the perspective of the 16th-century worldview, the actual voyage of Vasco da Gama is a documented historical event. However, Camões embellishes this narrative with invented details, such as the intervention of classical gods and fantastical occurrences, which were not part of the historical record but were consistent with the literary and cultural norms of the time. 

Given the context of the period, the inclusion of mythological elements would have been seen as a poetic device rather than a literal account. Therefore, while the core event (the voyage) is historical, the embellishments are invented and improbable according to the beliefs of the time, but not impossible, as they align with the mythological understanding of the world.

In the context of the 16th century, the existence of giants like Gargantua would have been considered improbable. While folklore and myth often included giants, they were not believed to be real by the educated classes of the time. The character of Gargantua is a product of Rabelais' imagination, serving as a vehicle for satire and social commentary. Given the historical context and the nature of the character, Gargantua's existence would not have been considered possible, as it requires a soft violation of the laws of the real world, such as the existence of giants. Therefore, the character of Gargantua would be evaluated as an invented character whose existence is not possible because it requires few or soft violations of the laws of the real world. Score=4","""Gargantua"" by François Rabelais is a satirical and fantastical work that features a mix of real and invented locations.

However, the work also introduces entirely fictional locations, such as the Abbey of Thélème, which embodies Rabelais' utopian ideals and satirical commentary on monastic life. 

Considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the 16th century, the existence of such a utopian abbey would be improbable, as it defies the social and religious norms of the time. However, it does not require extreme violations of the laws of the real world, as it is more a social and cultural satire than a fantastical impossibility. Therefore, the invented locations in ""Gargantua"" are not possible in the context of the period, but they do not involve frequent or extreme violations of natural laws.

Score=4","""Gargantua"" by François Rabelais is a satirical and comedic work that features the life and adventures of the giant Gargantua. The events in the book are highly exaggerated and fantastical, reflecting the Renaissance period's penchant for blending humor with social commentary. The narrative includes events such as Gargantua's miraculous birth, his prodigious appetite, and his extraordinary feats of strength and intellect. These events are clearly invented and are not grounded in historical reality. 

Considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the 16th century, while there was a fascination with giants and mythical creatures, the specific events described in ""Gargantua"" would have been recognized as fictional and humorous exaggerations rather than probable historical occurrences. The events require frequent and extreme violations of the laws of the real world, such as the existence of giants and their implausible actions.

These characters are fictional, but they are crafted to represent real social types and classes of 14th-century England. Chaucer's characters are not based on specific historical figures, but they are plausible representations of people who could have existed during that time.

Chaucer's descriptions of the journey and the places along the way, such as the Tabard Inn in Southwark, are based on real locations that would have been familiar to his contemporary audience.

The pilgrimage itself, as a framework for the tales, is an actual historical event with invented details. Pilgrimages to Canterbury were indeed common during this period, and Chaucer uses this real-life practice as a backdrop for his fictional narratives. The individual tales, however, are largely invented and serve as a vehicle for Chaucer's commentary on various aspects of medieval society.

The events in the story are not actual historical events but are instead symbolic representations of real historical events and figures. The animals' rebellion against the farmer and the subsequent establishment of their own governance system is an allegory for the Russian Revolution and the rise of communism.

From the perspective of the historical period in which the book was written (1945), the events depicted in ""Animal Farm"" are not actual historical events but are invented to illustrate and critique real historical occurrences. The idea of animals organizing a rebellion and establishing a government is not probable within the worldview and beliefs of people in 1945, as it requires a soft violation of the laws of the real world (e.g., animals possessing human-like intelligence and political agency).

Therefore, the events in ""Animal Farm"" are best categorized as invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible because it requires few or soft violations of the laws of the real world.

"The Pilgrim's Progress","John Bunyan",1678,"England","The Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan written in 1678","""The Pilgrim's Progress"" by John Bunyan is an allegorical work featuring characters that are symbolic representations of various virtues, vices, and aspects of the Christian faith. The main protagonist, Christian, along with other characters like Faithful, Hopeful, and Evangelist, are not intended to be real individuals but rather personifications of spiritual and moral concepts. 

In the context of the 17th century, when the work was written, these characters were understood as allegorical figures rather than historical or probable individuals. Their existence is not probable in the sense of being real people, as they are explicitly crafted to embody abstract ideas and guide the reader through a spiritual journey. 

Given that these characters are invented and their existence is not probable as real individuals, but they do not require violations of the laws of the real world (as they are allegorical), they fit the criteria for a score of 3.

Score=3","""The Pilgrim's Progress"" by John Bunyan is an allegorical work that describes the journey of its protagonist, Christian, from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City. The settings in the book, such as the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, and the Celestial City, are entirely invented and serve as symbolic representations of spiritual and moral challenges rather than real geographical locations. 

Given the historical context of the 17th century, these locations were understood by contemporary readers as allegorical rather than literal. The existence of such places is not possible because they are designed to represent abstract concepts and spiritual states rather than physical places. However, they do not require extreme violations of the laws of the real world, as they are more metaphorical than fantastical.

Therefore, based on the scale provided, the settings in ""The Pilgrim's Progress"" would be classified as invented locations whose existence is not possible because it requires few or soft violations of the laws of the real world.

Score=4","""The Pilgrim's Progress"" by John Bunyan is an allegorical work that depicts the journey of a character named Christian from his hometown, the City of Destruction, to the Celestial City. The narrative is rich with symbolic events and places, such as the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, and the Delectable Mountains, which represent various spiritual and moral challenges and experiences.

From the perspective of the 17th-century worldview, the events in ""The Pilgrim's Progress"" are not intended to be historical or factual but are rather allegorical representations of a Christian's spiritual journey. The events are invented and serve as metaphors for spiritual truths and moral lessons. While the allegory reflects the religious beliefs and spiritual struggles of the time, the events themselves are not historical and do not claim to have occurred in reality.

Given that the events are allegorical and not meant to be taken as literal historical occurrences, they fall into the category of invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible because they are symbolic rather than literal. However, they do not require extreme violations of the laws of the real world, as they are understood within the context of spiritual allegory.

They are not based on real individuals, but their characteristics and experiences are conceivable within the societal norms and expectations of the period. Therefore, the characters fall into the category of invented characters whose existence is probable. Score=2","""La Nouvelle Héloïse"" by Jean-Jacques Rousseau is set in real geographical locations, primarily in Switzerland, particularly around the Lake Geneva region.

However, these embellishments do not alter the fundamental reality of the locations. Given the historical context of the 18th century, the settings would have been recognized as real by contemporary readers, with any romanticized details seen as artistic rather than factual deviations. Therefore, the work fits the category of real geographical locations with invented details. Score=1","""La Nouvelle Héloïse"" by Jean-Jacques Rousseau is an epistolary novel that primarily explores themes of love, morality, and society through the correspondence between its characters.

The main protagonists in the novel are fictional characters, such as Juliana Frink, Frank Frink, and Nobusuke Tagomi. These characters are invented and do not correspond to real historical figures. However, their existence is probable within the context of the novel's alternate history setting, as they are ordinary people living in a world that diverged from our own due to historical events. The characters themselves do not require any violations of the laws of the real world to exist; they are simply part of a speculative scenario. Therefore, according to the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, these characters would be considered invented but probable. Score=2","""The Man in the High Castle"" by Philip K. Dick is set in an alternate history where the Axis powers won World War II, leading to a divided United States controlled by Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. The geographical locations in the novel, such as San Francisco and New York, are real and known to exist. However, the details of these locations are significantly altered to fit the alternate history narrative. The existence of this alternate reality is not probable, as it requires a different outcome of historical events, but it does not involve violations of the laws of the real world. Therefore, the setting involves real geographical locations with invented details that are improbable but not impossible. 

Score=1","""The Man in the High Castle"" by Philip K. Dick is an alternate history novel that explores a world in which the Axis powers won World War II. The novel presents a scenario where the United States is divided between the Japanese Empire and Nazi Germany. 

From the perspective of the historical period in which the novel was written (1962), the events described are entirely invented. The actual outcome of World War II was a victory for the Allied powers, and there is no historical basis for the division of the United States as depicted in the novel. However, the concept of an alternate history where the Axis powers could have won the war is a speculative scenario that, while not probable, does not require violations of the laws of the real world. It is a ""what if"" scenario that explores a different historical trajectory based on real events.

Given the criteria, the events in the novel are invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable, as they rely on a significant divergence from known historical outcomes without requiring any supernatural or impossible elements.

The main protagonists include the Master, Margarita, and Woland (a representation of the Devil). 

1. The Master and Margarita are invented characters whose existence is probable within the context of the novel's setting in Soviet Russia. They are portrayed as ordinary humans with no supernatural attributes, making their existence plausible in the historical period of the work. 

2. Woland, on the other hand, is a supernatural character representing the Devil. His existence requires frequent and extreme violations of the laws of the real world, as he possesses magical powers and orchestrates fantastical events throughout the novel. 

Considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, the existence of a character like Woland would not be possible, as it involves significant supernatural elements that go beyond the realm of probability.

Therefore, evaluating the main protagonists, the degree of invention and the impossibility of Woland's existence due to supernatural elements lead to the following score:

Score=5","""The Master and Margarita"" by Mikhail Bulgakov is a novel that features a blend of real and fantastical settings. The primary setting is Moscow, a real geographical location, which is depicted with a mix of realistic and surreal elements. The novel also includes fantastical settings such as Satan's ball and the realm of Pontius Pilate, which are not bound by the laws of the real world. These settings require a suspension of disbelief and involve supernatural occurrences, such as characters flying and interacting with the devil. Given the historical context of the 1930s Soviet Union, the fantastical elements would have been seen as improbable or impossible, involving frequent violations of the natural laws. Therefore, the settings in ""The Master and Margarita"" can be evaluated as invented locations whose existence is not possible because they require frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world. Score=5","""The Master and Margarita"" by Mikhail Bulgakov is a complex novel that intertwines various narratives, including a retelling of the trial of Jesus in Jerusalem, the story of the Devil visiting Soviet Moscow, and the love story between the Master and Margarita. 

The novel includes several elements that require evaluation:

1. The retelling of the trial of Jesus: This part of the narrative is based on actual historical events with invented details, as it presents a fictionalized account of Pontius Pilate and Jesus, which aligns with historical records but includes creative embellishments. This would be evaluated as Score=1.

2. The Devil's visit to Moscow: This narrative involves supernatural elements, such as the Devil (Woland) and his retinue performing magical acts in Soviet Moscow. From the perspective of the historical period in which the novel is set (1930s Soviet Union), the occurrence of such events would not be considered possible, as they require violations of the natural laws. However, considering the worldview of the time, where supernatural beliefs were not entirely dismissed, this would be evaluated as Score=4.

3. The love story between the Master and Margarita: While the love story itself is plausible, the events surrounding Margarita's transformation into a witch and her participation in the Devil's ball involve supernatural occurrences. These events would also be considered impossible due to the required violations of natural laws, evaluated as Score=4.

Overall, the novel's events, particularly those involving supernatural elements, are not possible within the historical and cultural context of the time, requiring soft violations of the laws of the real world. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the work's events is Score=4.",5,NA,5,NA

Billy Pilgrim is a World War II soldier and prisoner of war who becomes ""unstuck in time"" and experiences events from his life out of chronological order. He also claims to have been abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. 

From the perspective of the historical period in which the novel was written (1969), the existence of a character like Billy Pilgrim is not probable. While soldiers and prisoners of war are real and documented, the aspects of Billy's experiences that involve time travel and alien abduction require violations of the known laws of the real world. However, these violations are presented in a way that could be seen as metaphorical or allegorical, rather than literal, which might be considered a few or soft violations of reality.

Therefore, based on the scale provided, Billy Pilgrim's character would be evaluated as an invented character whose existence is not possible because it requires few or soft violations of the laws of the real world. Score=4","""Slaughterhouse-Five"" by Kurt Vonnegut is a novel that features a mix of real and invented locations.

However, the novel also includes the invented planet of Tralfamadore, which is a location that requires frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world, such as time travel and the existence of extraterrestrial life with a non-linear perception of time. Considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work (1969), the existence of Tralfamadore would not be considered possible. Therefore, the setting of Tralfamadore would be evaluated as an invented location whose existence is not possible due to frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world. Score=5","""Slaughterhouse-Five"" by Kurt Vonnegut is a novel that blends historical events with science fiction elements. The book is centered around the bombing of Dresden during World War II, which is an actual historical event. However, the narrative also includes invented details and events, such as the protagonist Billy Pilgrim becoming ""unstuck in time"" and experiencing moments of his life out of sequence. Additionally, the novel features the fictional alien race known as the Tralfamadorians, who abduct Billy and introduce him to their perception of time.

When evaluating the work based on the specified referent, we must consider the historical context of the 1960s, when the book was written. The bombing of Dresden is a documented historical event, but the time travel and alien abduction elements are inventions that require violations of the laws of the real world. Given the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, these elements would not be considered possible.

Therefore, the novel includes both actual historical events with invented details and invented events that require frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world. The presence of time travel and aliens places the work at a level where these events are not possible according to the understanding of the world at the time.

The main protagonists in these stories are typically invented characters whose existence is not probable or possible, given the nature of the narratives. Borges frequently blurs the line between reality and fiction, creating characters that embody abstract concepts or exist in paradoxical situations.

For example, in ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,"" the characters are involved in the discovery of an entirely fictional world that begins to encroach upon reality. In ""The Library of Babel,"" the protagonist exists in an infinite library, a concept that defies the physical laws of the real world. These characters are not possible within the constraints of the real world, even considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work.

Borges is known for creating fictional worlds that challenge the boundaries of reality and perception. 

In ""Ficciones,"" many of the settings are entirely invented and often involve elements that defy the laws of the real world. For example, in ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,"" Borges describes a fictional world with its own unique metaphysics and languages, which gradually begins to encroach upon the real world. This setting requires frequent and extreme violations of the laws of the real world, as it suggests the possibility of a fictional world becoming real through the power of belief and language.

Given the historical context of the 1940s, when Borges wrote these stories, the settings in ""Ficciones"" would have been seen as highly imaginative and not possible within the known laws of the real world at the time. Borges's work often blurs the line between reality and fiction, creating settings that are not just improbable but impossible according to the worldview of his era.

Borges is known for his intricate and imaginative storytelling, which frequently involves invented historical events and concepts that challenge the boundaries of possibility.

In evaluating the degree of invention, probability, and possibility of the events in ""Ficciones,"" we must consider the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work. Borges wrote during the mid-20th century, a time when literature was increasingly exploring abstract and philosophical ideas, often through speculative and fantastical narratives.

The stories in ""Ficciones"" include events such as the creation of an infinite library (""The Library of Babel""), the existence of a fictional country with its own language and culture (""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius""), and the concept of a man who can forget nothing (""Funes the Memorious""). These events are not grounded in actual historical occurrences and often involve elements that defy the laws of the real world, such as infinite structures or entirely fabricated worlds.

Given the nature of these stories, the events in ""Ficciones"" require frequent or extreme violations of the laws of the real world, as they delve into metaphysical and fantastical realms that are not possible within the constraints of reality as understood in Borges's time.

Saleem is born at the exact moment of India's independence and is endowed with telepathic powers, which he uses to connect with other children born in the first hour of India's independence, each of whom has their own magical abilities. 

From the perspective of the historical period in which the novel is set, the existence of a character like Saleem, with telepathic powers and a connection to other magically gifted children, would not be considered probable. The novel employs magical realism, a literary style that incorporates fantastical elements into a realistic setting, which would have been seen as a significant departure from the natural laws of the real world by the standards of the time.

However, Rushdie infuses these settings with magical realism, adding fantastical elements that are not part of the real world, such as the telepathic connection among the children born at the moment of India's independence.

From the perspective of the historical period in which the novel is set, the actual historical events are well-documented and known to have occurred. However, the magical elements, such as telepathy and other supernatural abilities, are not possible within the framework of the real world, even considering the beliefs of the time.

Considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, the settings in ""The Odyssey"" would be seen as invented locations whose existence is not probable but still within the realm of possibility due to the cultural acceptance of myth and legend. Therefore, the score reflects the ancient perspective rather than modern standards.

Score=3","""The Odyssey"" by Homer is an epic poem that recounts the adventures of Odysseus as he attempts to return home from the Trojan War. The narrative includes a mix of actual historical elements, such as the Trojan War itself, which is believed to have some basis in historical events, and a significant amount of mythological and fantastical elements, such as encounters with gods, monsters, and magical phenomena.

In evaluating the degree of invention, probability, and possibility according to the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, it is important to consider that the ancient Greeks believed in the existence of gods and mythical creatures, and these elements were integral to their understanding of the world. However, from a historical perspective, many of the specific events described in ""The Odyssey,"" such as Odysseus's encounters with the Cyclops, Circe, and the Sirens, are not probable or possible within the framework of real-world events, even by ancient standards.

Therefore, while the setting and some elements may have a basis in historical reality, the specific events of Odysseus's journey involve frequent and extreme violations of the laws of the real world, as understood even in the context of ancient Greek beliefs.

"Hamlet","William Shakespeare",1600,"England","Hamlet by William Shakespeare written in 1600","In William Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" the main protagonist is Prince Hamlet of Denmark. The character of Hamlet is an invented one, as there is no historical evidence to suggest that he was a real person. However, the character is based on legends and historical tales, such as the story of Amleth from the ""Gesta Danorum"" by Saxo Grammaticus, which was a source for Shakespeare. In the context of the early 17th century, when the play was written, the existence of a prince like Hamlet could be considered probable, as the play is set in a royal court and deals with themes of power, revenge, and family dynamics that were relevant and plausible in the historical context of the time. Therefore, Hamlet's existence as a character is not improbable, but rather a fictional creation grounded in the social and political realities of the period. Score=2","In ""Hamlet"" by William Shakespeare, the primary setting is Elsinore Castle in Denmark. During the time the play was written, Denmark was a well-known and real geographical location. Elsinore, or Helsingør, is a real town in Denmark, and Kronborg Castle, which is often associated with Elsinore Castle, is a real castle that existed during Shakespeare's time. The setting does not involve any invented locations or require any violations of the laws of the real world. Therefore, based on the criteria provided, the setting of ""Hamlet"" aligns with real geographical locations known or documented to exist. Score=0","In evaluating the events of ""Hamlet"" by William Shakespeare, we must consider the worldview and beliefs of people in the early 17th century. The play involves a mix of courtly intrigue, murder, and supernatural elements, such as the appearance of King Hamlet's ghost. 

During the Elizabethan era, belief in ghosts and the supernatural was common, and the idea that a ghost could appear to deliver a message or seek revenge was within the realm of possibility for people of that time. The political intrigue and murder within a royal family, while dramatic, are plausible events that could occur in any historical period. 

However, the presence of the ghost and its role in the narrative introduces an element that, while believable to contemporary audiences, involves a soft violation of the laws of the real world as understood today. Given the historical context, the ghost's appearance would be seen as possible, though not probable, by the standards of the time.

Therefore, considering the historical beliefs and the nature of the events, the play's events are best categorized as invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable, but possible within the worldview of the period.

"Moby-Dick","Herman Melville",1851,"United States","Moby-Dick by Herman Melville written in 1851","""Moby-Dick"" by Herman Melville features several main protagonists, including Ishmael, Captain Ahab, and the titular whale, Moby Dick. 

1. Ishmael: He is the narrator and a sailor on the whaling ship, the Pequod. Ishmael is a fictional character, but his existence is probable within the context of the 19th-century whaling industry. Many individuals like him would have existed, making him an invented character whose existence is probable. 

2. Captain Ahab: He is the monomaniacal captain of the Pequod, obsessed with hunting Moby Dick. While Ahab is a fictional character, captains with similar traits and obsessions could have existed in the whaling industry of the time. Thus, his existence is also probable.

3. Moby Dick: The white whale is a central character in the novel. While albino whales do exist, Moby Dick's characterization as a near-mythical creature with almost supernatural attributes makes his existence less probable. However, within the 19th-century worldview, such a creature could be seen as possible, albeit unlikely.

Considering the historical context and the nature of the characters, the main protagonists of ""Moby-Dick"" fall into the category of invented characters whose existence is probable. 

Score=2","""Moby-Dick"" by Herman Melville is set in real geographical locations, primarily focusing on the seas and oceans, particularly the Pacific Ocean, as well as specific ports and islands that were known and documented to exist during the 19th century. The novel includes detailed descriptions of whaling voyages and maritime life, which were based on Melville's own experiences and the whaling industry of the time. While there are some embellishments and dramatic elements in the narrative, the settings themselves are grounded in reality and reflect the geographical knowledge of the period. Therefore, the work should be evaluated as having real geographical locations, known or documented to exist. Score=0","""Moby-Dick"" by Herman Melville is a novel that blends actual historical events with fictional elements. The central event of the novel is Captain Ahab's obsessive pursuit of the white whale, Moby Dick. Whaling was indeed a significant industry in the 19th century, and the novel accurately depicts many aspects of whaling life and practices of the time. However, the specific events surrounding the hunt for Moby Dick, particularly the whale's almost supernatural characteristics and Ahab's monomaniacal quest, are fictionalized and dramatized for narrative effect.

In the context of the 19th-century worldview, while whaling expeditions and encounters with large whales were common, the specific events of a single whale being pursued with such personal vendetta and the whale's almost mythical status would be seen as improbable. The novel does not require violations of the laws of the real world, but it does stretch the probability of such events occurring as described.

Therefore, considering the historical context and the blend of real and fictional elements, the events in ""Moby-Dick"" can be categorized as invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable.

"Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813,"United Kingdom","Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen written in 1813","""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen, written in 1813, features characters that are entirely invented by the author. However, these characters are crafted with a high degree of realism and are representative of the social classes and norms of early 19th-century England. The main protagonists, such as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, are fictional but are portrayed in a manner that makes their existence highly probable within the context of the time period. They embody the characteristics, behaviors, and societal roles that were typical of the English gentry and middle class during the Regency era. Therefore, while they are not real historical figures, their existence is plausible and aligns with the worldview and beliefs of people in that historical period. 

Score=2","""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen is set in early 19th-century England, primarily in rural areas such as Hertfordshire, Derbyshire, and Kent. These are real geographical locations known to exist, and the novel does not introduce any invented details that alter their fundamental nature.

Salinger is a novel centered around the protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Holden is a fictional character, but his existence is highly probable within the context of the 1950s in the United States. He is portrayed as a teenager dealing with issues of identity, belonging, and alienation, which are common human experiences.

"The Road","Cormac McCarthy",2006,"United States","The Road by Cormac McCarthy written in 2006","""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy is a post-apocalyptic novel that follows the journey of a father and his young son as they navigate a desolate landscape. The main protagonists, the father and the son, are invented characters. Their existence is probable within the context of the novel's setting, as they are human beings with no supernatural attributes or abilities. The novel does not require any violations of the laws of the real world for these characters to exist, as they are simply surviving in a world that has undergone a catastrophic event. Given the historical period of the work (contemporary to its publication), the existence of such characters is entirely plausible. Therefore, the characters fall into the category of invented characters whose existence is probable. Score=2","""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy is set in a post-apocalyptic world that is largely based on real geographical locations, albeit with significant alterations due to the catastrophic events that have occurred. The novel describes a landscape that is recognizable as the United States, with references to real places, but these locations are depicted in a state of extreme devastation and desolation. The setting involves a world where the environment has been drastically altered, but it does not require violations of the laws of the real world to imagine such a scenario. Given the historical period of the work (2006), the concept of a post-apocalyptic world is within the realm of possibility, though it involves significant speculative elements. Therefore, the setting can be classified as real geographical locations with invented details. Score=1","""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy is a post-apocalyptic novel that depicts a world devastated by an unspecified cataclysmic event. The events in the novel revolve around the survival journey of a father and his son through a barren, ash-covered landscape. 

In evaluating the events of the novel, we must consider the worldview and beliefs of people in 2006, the year the book was published. By this time, the concept of a post-apocalyptic world was well-established in literature and media, often reflecting societal fears about nuclear war, environmental collapse, or other global catastrophes. While the specific event that caused the apocalypse in ""The Road"" is not detailed, the idea of a world-ending event is not outside the realm of possibility given the concerns of the time.

However, the extent of the devastation and the complete collapse of civilization as depicted in the novel, with the world reduced to a nearly lifeless state, involves a level of destruction that, while conceivable in speculative fiction, is not probable based on historical events or scientific understanding of the time. The novel's portrayal of a world where almost all life has been extinguished and the environment is irreversibly damaged requires a significant leap from known historical events.

Therefore, the events in ""The Road"" are best categorized as invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable, given the worldview and beliefs of people in 2006.

"The Hunger Games","Suzanne Collins",2008,"United States","The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins written in 2008","""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins is a dystopian novel set in a future version of North America known as Panem. The main protagonist is Katniss Everdeen, a character who participates in a televised survival competition. 

In evaluating the character of Katniss Everdeen, we must consider the context of the novel's setting. The story is set in a speculative future with a society that has evolved from our current world. While the character of Katniss is entirely fictional, her existence is plausible within the context of the novel's world. She is a human with no supernatural abilities, and her experiences and characteristics are grounded in reality, albeit in a future society that is different from our own.

Given that Katniss is an invented character whose existence is probable within the speculative future setting of the novel, she fits the criteria for a score of 2 on the provided scale. 

Score=2","""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins is set in a dystopian future version of North America, known as Panem. The geographical locations in the book, such as the Capitol and the various districts, are entirely invented. However, they are based on a reimagined version of a real continent, which gives them a semblance of plausibility in terms of geography. The existence of these locations is not probable in the real world, as they are part of a speculative future scenario. However, they do not require any violations of the laws of the real world, as they are simply a fictional reorganization of existing geography. Therefore, according to the scale provided, the setting of ""The Hunger Games"" would be classified as invented locations whose existence is not probable. Score=3","""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins is a dystopian novel set in a future society where a totalitarian government, known as the Capitol, holds an annual event called the Hunger Games. In these games, children from various districts are selected to fight to the death in a controlled arena. 

Evaluating the events of the novel based on the specified referent, we consider the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, which is set in a speculative future. The concept of a government using a televised death match as a means of control and entertainment is an invented historical event. While the idea of a totalitarian regime is not new and has historical precedents, the specific occurrence of the Hunger Games as described in the novel is not probable. It involves a society that has evolved in a way that is not consistent with historical trends or current societal structures, even when considering the potential for future dystopian developments.

Therefore, the events in ""The Hunger Games"" require a significant suspension of disbelief regarding societal evolution and human behavior, but they do not involve violations of the laws of the real world, such as physics or biology. Thus, the events are best categorized as invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable.
