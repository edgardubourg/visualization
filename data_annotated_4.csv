"The Bible","Various",100,"Middle East","The Bible by Various written in 100","Evaluating the main protagonists of the Bible, such as figures like Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, requires considering the historical and cultural context of the time. Many of these characters are believed to have been real individuals by the people of the historical period in which the Bible was written. For instance, Abraham and Moses are central figures in Jewish tradition, and Jesus is a foundational figure in Christianity. These characters are often considered to have existed, though their stories may include miraculous events or divine interactions that are not verifiable by historical methods. However, the belief in their existence was strong among the people of the time, and they are often treated as historical figures within their respective religious traditions. Therefore, based on the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, these characters would be considered real or believed to have existed. Score=0","Evaluating the Bible, particularly focusing on the events described within its texts, requires considering the worldview and beliefs of people during the historical period in which it was written. The Bible contains a mix of historical events, religious teachings, and mythological narratives. 

1. **Actual Historical Events**: Some events, such as the existence of certain historical figures and places, align with archaeological and historical evidence. For example, the existence of the Kingdom of Israel and certain kings like David and Solomon are supported by historical records. These would be considered as Score=0 or Score=1 depending on the level of detail and embellishment.

2. **Invented Historical Events**: Many events in the Bible, such as the creation story in Genesis, the parting of the Red Sea, and the miracles performed by Jesus, are considered by modern standards to be mythological or symbolic. However, in the context of the time, these events were often believed to be possible due to divine intervention.

3. **Probability and Possibility**: Events like the Great Flood or the Tower of Babel, while not supported by modern historical or scientific evidence, were within the realm of possibility for ancient peoples who believed in the omnipotence of God. These events might be seen as Score=2 or Score=3, as they involve divine actions that were considered possible within the belief systems of the time.

4. **Violations of Real-World Laws**: Miraculous events, such as the resurrection of Jesus or the transformation of water into wine, involve violations of natural laws. For the people of the time, these were seen as acts of divine power, making them possible within their worldview, but they would require moderate to extreme violations of real-world laws by modern standards.

Considering the worldview of the time and the nature of the events described, the Bible contains a range of events from historical to mythological. Overall, many of the miraculous events would be categorized as requiring moderate to extreme violations of real-world laws, but within the context of divine intervention, they were seen as possible.

Score=5","Evaluating the geographical settings of the Bible, particularly considering the worldview and beliefs of people around the year 100 CE, involves recognizing a mix of real and invented locations. Many locations in the Bible, such as Jerusalem, Egypt, and Babylon, are real geographical places that were well-known to people of that time. However, the Bible also includes locations like the Garden of Eden and the Land of Nod, which are more mythical or symbolic in nature. 

From the perspective of people in the historical period of the Bible, these locations might have been considered possible or even probable, as they were part of the cultural and religious narratives of the time. The existence of such places would not have required extreme violations of the real-world laws as understood by people of that era, but they do involve some degree of invention and mythological interpretation.

Given this context, the Bible's settings can be seen as a blend of real locations with invented details and some invented locations whose existence might have been considered possible or probable by the people of that time. Therefore, the score reflects the mix of real and mythological elements, leaning towards the invented but plausible within the historical context.

"The Epic of Gilgamesh","Anonymous",-2100,"Mesopotamia","The Epic of Gilgamesh by Anonymous written in -2100","The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian literary work that features the main protagonist, Gilgamesh, who is described as a historical king of Uruk. However, the narrative includes numerous mythological elements and divine attributes, such as Gilgamesh being two-thirds god and one-third human. This blend of historical and mythological aspects reflects the beliefs of the time, where divine ancestry and extraordinary feats were often attributed to rulers. While Gilgamesh may have been based on a real king, the epic's portrayal involves significant mythological embellishments that go beyond mere biographical invention. Therefore, considering the worldview of the period, Gilgamesh's character would be classified as a real character with invented biographical details. Score=1","The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian text that blends historical elements with mythological and fantastical events. The narrative includes the historical figure of Gilgamesh, who was a king of Uruk, suggesting a basis in actual historical events. However, the epic also features numerous mythological elements, such as interactions with gods, the creation of Enkidu by the goddess Aruru, and the journey to the Cedar Forest to battle the monster Humbaba. Additionally, the story includes a great flood narrative, which parallels other ancient flood myths. 

From the perspective of the people in the historical period of the work, these mythological elements were likely seen as possible within their worldview, which included a pantheon of gods actively influencing human affairs. However, from a modern perspective, these events involve significant violations of real-world laws, such as divine intervention and mythical creatures. 

Considering the worldview of the time, the events in the epic would be seen as possible but involve minor to moderate violations of real-world laws as understood by the people of that era. Therefore, the work can be evaluated as involving invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible but involves moderate violations of real-world laws.

Score=5","The Epic of Gilgamesh is an ancient Mesopotamian text that features a mix of real and mythical locations. The city of Uruk, where much of the story takes place, is a real geographical location that was a significant urban center in ancient Sumer. Other locations, such as the Cedar Forest and the abode of the gods, are more mythical in nature. The Cedar Forest, while based on real cedar forests in the region, is depicted with fantastical elements, such as being guarded by the monster Humbaba. The journey to the ends of the earth and the crossing of the Waters of Death to reach Utnapishtim also involve mythical geography. Given the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, these locations would have been seen as possible but not probable, as they blend real geographical knowledge with mythological elements.

The existence of such characters requires moderate violations of real-world laws, as they operate within a magical framework that is not possible according to the natural laws of our world. However, the series is set in a world that closely resembles our own, with the magical elements being hidden from the non-magical population. Given the historical period of the work (late 20th century), the belief in such magical characters is not supported by the prevailing worldview. Therefore, the characters are invented and their existence is not possible, involving moderate violations of real-world laws. Score=5","The ""Harry Potter"" series by J.K.

From the perspective of the historical period in which the series was written (late 20th century), these events are not possible and require significant violations of real-world laws. The existence of a hidden magical society, the use of wands to cast spells, and the presence of magical creatures like dragons and house-elves are all elements that involve extreme violations of the natural laws as understood in the modern world.

These locations are crafted with a magical context that involves moderate violations of real-world laws, such as the existence of magic, magical creatures, and enchanted objects. While these settings are not possible in the real world, they are presented in a way that is internally consistent within the magical universe of the series. Given the historical period of the work (late 20th century), the existence of such magical locations would not be considered probable or possible according to the real-world understanding of that time.

These characters are invented but their existence is entirely possible within the context of the late 20th century, as they are based on real-world professions and roles. The series does not require any significant suspension of disbelief regarding the characters themselves, as they do not possess supernatural abilities or characteristics that defy real-world laws. Therefore, the main protagonists fall into the category of invented characters whose existence would be possible. Score=2","The ""Shark Attack"" film series, starting with the first film directed by Bob Misiorowski in 1999, revolves around the premise of aggressive and often mutated sharks attacking humans. While shark attacks are real historical events, the series often exaggerates these occurrences with elements such as genetically altered sharks or sharks behaving in ways that are not typical of their species. 

In evaluating the degree of invention, probability, and possibility according to the worldview and beliefs of people in the late 20th century, the series presents scenarios that are not probable. The idea of sharks being genetically modified to become more aggressive or to exhibit unusual behaviors involves a moderate violation of real-world biological laws as understood at the time. While genetic modification was a known concept, the specific outcomes depicted in the films are not scientifically plausible.

Therefore, the events in the ""Shark Attack"" series would be classified as invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible but involves moderate violations of real-world laws. 

Score=5","The ""Shark Attack"" film series primarily takes place in real-world locations, such as coastal areas and oceans, which are known to exist. The settings are based on actual geographical locations where shark attacks could plausibly occur. While the films may include some exaggerated or fictionalized details about these locations for dramatic effect, the geographical settings themselves are grounded in reality. Therefore, the degree of invention is minimal, and the settings align with real-world geography and possibilities.

He is an ordinary man with a job, personal thoughts, and emotions, all of which are consistent with real human behavior. Given the historical period of the work, the character does not require any violations of real-world laws to exist.

The story is set in a realistic courtly environment, and the characters are depicted with human emotions and social interactions that align with the historical and cultural context of the time. There are no supernatural elements or violations of real-world laws in the characterization of Genji.

Score=2","""The Tale of Genji"" by Murasaki Shikibu is a classic work of Japanese literature from the Heian period. It is often considered the world's first novel. The narrative follows the life and loves of Hikaru Genji, a nobleman, and is set in a courtly environment that reflects the customs and culture of the time.

In terms of historical events, ""The Tale of Genji"" does not focus on actual historical events or figures. Instead, it presents a fictionalized account of court life, with invented characters and events. The story is deeply rooted in the cultural and social norms of the Heian period, making the events plausible within that context, even though they are not based on real historical occurrences.

Given the worldview and beliefs of people during the Heian period, the events in ""The Tale of Genji"" would be seen as possible, as they reflect the intricacies of court life, relationships, and politics of the time. There are no supernatural elements or significant violations of real-world laws in the narrative.

The narrative includes detailed descriptions of the imperial court and various residences, gardens, and landscapes that reflect the real-world geography and cultural context of the Heian period.

While the novel may include some artistic embellishments or idealized portrayals of these settings, they are grounded in the actual geography and social structures of the time.

Siegfried, for instance, is a legendary hero with traits such as invulnerability (except for a single spot) due to bathing in dragon's blood, which involves minor violations of real-world laws. However, the existence of such a character would have been considered possible within the mythological and legendary framework of the time. Kriemhild and Hagen, while involved in legendary narratives, are depicted in ways that align with the social and cultural norms of the period, making their existence more plausible.

These elements reflect the beliefs and storytelling traditions of the time, which often included fantastical occurrences as part of their worldview. While the setting and some events may have historical roots, the inclusion of dragons and invulnerability involves minor violations of real-world laws as understood in the medieval period.

"The Divine Comedy","Dante Alighieri",1320,"Italy","The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri written in 1320","In ""The Divine Comedy"" by Dante Alighieri, the main protagonist is Dante himself, who embarks on a journey through Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise. Dante, as a historical figure, was a real person, and his character in the poem is based on his own life and experiences. However, the journey he undertakes is a fictional and allegorical one, involving encounters with various historical, mythological, and fictional characters. 

From the perspective of people in the historical period of the work, the existence of Dante as a character is real, but the journey he undertakes involves interactions with supernatural beings and realms that are not possible according to real-world laws. However, these elements are deeply rooted in the religious and cultural beliefs of the time, which accepted the existence of an afterlife and divine intervention as part of their worldview. 

Given that Dante is a real character with an invented journey that involves minor violations of real-world laws (such as traveling through the afterlife), the appropriate score is based on the character's existence and the nature of his journey. 

Score=1","The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri is a narrative poem that describes the journey of the protagonist, Dante, through the realms of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven. The events depicted in the poem involve a detailed exploration of the afterlife, which includes encounters with historical and mythological figures, as well as allegorical representations of theological concepts. 

From the perspective of people in the historical period when the work was written, the existence of an afterlife was a widely held belief, and the structure of Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven as described by Dante was influenced by the religious and philosophical ideas of the time. However, the specific events and detailed descriptions of the afterlife, such as the various circles of Hell and the punishments assigned to different sins, are imaginative constructs created by Dante for the purpose of his allegory.

While the concept of an afterlife was considered possible and even probable according to the beliefs of the period, the specific events and detailed depictions in The Divine Comedy involve significant creative invention. These events require moderate violations of real-world laws, as they describe a supernatural journey that cannot occur in the physical world.

Score=5","The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri is a literary work that describes a journey through three realms: Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise). These settings are deeply rooted in the medieval Christian worldview and are not based on real geographical locations. 

1. **Inferno**: This is depicted as a series of concentric circles beneath the Earth, each representing different sins and punishments. While the concept of Hell was a widely accepted belief in the medieval period, the specific geography and structure described by Dante are invented and not possible according to real-world laws.

2. **Purgatorio**: This is portrayed as a mountain on the opposite side of the Earth from Jerusalem. The idea of Purgatory was a theological concept, but the physical mountain described by Dante does not exist and involves a moderate violation of real-world geography.

3. **Paradiso**: This realm is depicted as a series of celestial spheres surrounding the Earth, based on the Ptolemaic system. While the Ptolemaic model was accepted at the time, the specific heavenly realms described by Dante are not possible according to real-world laws.

Considering the medieval context and the theological basis for these settings, they involve moderate to extreme violations of real-world laws, but they were conceptually possible within the beliefs of the time. Therefore, the settings in The Divine Comedy are best categorized as invented locations whose existence is not possible and requires moderate violations of real-world laws.

The main protagonists, such as King Arthur, Sir Lancelot, and Merlin, are invented characters whose existence is not probable. However, they are based on a mix of historical figures, folklore, and mythological elements. In the context of the 15th century, these characters were often perceived as legendary but not entirely impossible, as they were rooted in the chivalric ideals and historical traditions of the time. Merlin, as a wizard, involves minor violations of real-world laws, but the other characters are more grounded in the realm of possibility, albeit improbable. Therefore, considering the historical context and beliefs of the period, the characters would be assessed as invented with improbable existence. Score=3","""Le Morte d’Arthur"" by Sir Thomas Malory is a compilation of Arthurian legends, which are a blend of historical elements and mythological embellishments. The work is set in a time that is believed to be around the late 5th to early 6th century, a period that is historically associated with the post-Roman era in Britain. 

The legends of King Arthur, the Knights of the Round Table, and the quest for the Holy Grail are central to the narrative. While there may be some historical basis for a leader like Arthur existing during this time, the specific events described in Malory's work, such as the magical elements, the existence of characters like Merlin, and the supernatural occurrences, are largely invented and involve significant violations of real-world laws as understood in the 15th century.

Given the worldview of people in the historical period when Malory wrote, the events would have been seen as legendary and not probable, but they were not entirely outside the realm of possibility due to the belief in magic and the supernatural. However, the extent of the magical and fantastical elements places the work in a category where the events are not possible and require moderate violations of real-world laws.

Score=5","""Le Morte d’Arthur"" by Sir Thomas Malory is a compilation of Arthurian legends, which are set in a mix of real and fictional locations. The work includes real geographical locations such as England and France, which were well-known to people in the 15th century. However, it also features invented places like Camelot and Avalon. 

Camelot, while a central location in Arthurian legend, is not a real place and is not based on any specific historical site. Its existence would be possible within the context of the medieval worldview, as it does not require any significant violation of the natural laws understood at the time. Avalon, on the other hand, is a mystical island associated with magic and the supernatural, which would have been seen as less probable but still within the realm of possibility given the medieval belief in magic and the supernatural.

Considering the historical context and the belief systems of the time, the invented locations in ""Le Morte d’Arthur"" involve minor violations of real-world laws, primarily due to their association with magic and the supernatural. Therefore, the work would be evaluated as involving invented locations whose existence is not possible but involves minor violations of real-world laws.

While his actions and beliefs are eccentric and exaggerated, they do not involve any violations of real-world laws. His existence is plausible as a person who has become delusional due to excessive reading of romantic tales, which was a conceivable scenario during Cervantes' time. Therefore, Don Quixote fits the category of invented characters whose existence would be possible. Score=2","""Don Quixote"" by Miguel de Cervantes is a satirical novel that explores the adventures of a man who believes himself to be a knight-errant. The events in the novel are largely invented and are meant to parody the chivalric romances popular during Cervantes' time.

However, these events do not involve violations of real-world laws; they are simply the result of Don Quixote's misinterpretations and imagination. Given the worldview and beliefs of people in the early 17th century, these events would be seen as improbable but not impossible, as they are grounded in the character's perception rather than supernatural or fantastical elements. Therefore, the events in ""Don Quixote"" can be classified as invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable.

The story includes events such as playing hooky, attending school, exploring caves, and witnessing a murder. These events are reflective of the time period and are plausible within the context of the 19th-century American setting. While some details may be exaggerated for narrative effect, the events themselves are grounded in the reality of the era and are not fantastical or impossible according to the beliefs and worldview of the time.

The geographical setting is rooted in real locations along the Mississippi River, with details that reflect the time period and environment accurately. While St. Petersburg itself is a fictional name, the setting is a realistic portrayal of a small American town in the mid-19th century.

The characters' existence is entirely possible within the historical and social framework of the period in which the novel is set. There are no supernatural or fantastical elements associated with these characters that would violate real-world laws. Therefore, according to the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, the characters are invented but their existence would be possible. Score=2","""Les Misérables"" by Victor Hugo is a novel set in early 19th-century France, primarily during the years following the Napoleonic Wars and leading up to the June Rebellion of 1832. The events depicted in the novel are largely based on actual historical events, such as the Battle of Waterloo and the aforementioned rebellion. However, Hugo embellishes these events with fictional details and characters to enhance the narrative and explore themes of justice, redemption, and social inequality.

The June Rebellion, for instance, is a real historical event, but the specific actions and outcomes involving the characters in the novel are invented. These fictional elements are plausible within the historical context and do not require any suspension of disbelief regarding the laws of nature or historical possibility.

Given that the novel incorporates actual historical events with invented details that are plausible within the historical context, the appropriate score for ""Les Misérables"" is:

However, the novel is a quintessential example of magical realism, where fantastical elements are interwoven with the mundane. Despite this, the characters themselves do not inherently violate real-world laws; rather, it is the events and occurrences around them that do. Therefore, the characters' existence is possible, and they are not subject to the magical elements that would make their existence improbable or impossible. Score=2","""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" by Gabriel García Márquez is a seminal work of magical realism, a genre that blends fantastical elements with realistic settings and events. The novel chronicles the multi-generational story of the Buendía family in the fictional town of Macondo. 

The events in the novel include numerous instances of magical realism, such as characters who live for over a century, a rain of yellow flowers, and a character who ascends to heaven. These events are not possible according to real-world laws, but they are presented in a way that is seamlessly integrated into the narrative, reflecting the beliefs and cultural narratives of Latin American folklore and myth.

Given the worldview and beliefs of the characters within the novel, these events are accepted as part of their reality. However, from an objective standpoint, they involve moderate to extreme violations of real-world laws, such as gravity and mortality. Therefore, the events in ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" would be classified as invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible and requires moderate to extreme violations of real-world laws.

Score=5","""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" by Gabriel García Márquez is set in the fictional town of Macondo. Macondo is an invented location, but it is crafted with such vivid detail and cultural authenticity that it feels like a plausible place within the context of Latin American geography and history. The town is depicted with realistic elements that reflect the socio-political and cultural environment of Colombia and Latin America during the time periods covered in the novel. The existence of Macondo would be possible within the worldview and beliefs of people in the mid-20th century, as it does not require any violations of real-world laws. Therefore, the setting of Macondo can be classified as an invented location whose existence would be possible. Score=2",2,5,2,9

In the context of the 17th century, the idea of traveling to the moon was purely speculative and involved significant violations of the real-world laws as understood at the time. The protagonist's journey involves imaginative technologies and concepts that were not possible according to the scientific knowledge of that era. Therefore, the character's existence and the nature of his journey would require moderate violations of real-world laws as perceived in the 17th century. Score=5","""Voyage dans la lune"" by Cyrano de Bergerac, written in the 17th century, is a work that describes a fictional journey to the moon. During this period, the concept of space travel was purely speculative and not grounded in scientific reality. The events described in the book, such as traveling to the moon using fantastical methods like being lifted by dew or using fireworks, involve significant violations of the real-world laws of physics as understood even in the 17th century. While the idea of celestial travel was a topic of philosophical and speculative interest, the methods and events described in the work are not possible according to the scientific knowledge of the time. Therefore, the work involves moderate to extreme violations of real-world laws from the perspective of the 17th century. Score=5","""Voyage dans la lune"" by Cyrano de Bergerac, written in the 17th century, is a work that explores the idea of traveling to the moon. During this period, the moon was a subject of fascination and speculation, but it was not considered a real geographical location that humans could visit. The moon was known to exist, but the details of its surface and the possibility of traveling there were purely speculative and imaginative.

In the context of the 17th century, the idea of a voyage to the moon involved significant imaginative leaps and was not grounded in the scientific understanding of the time. The moon was an invented location in terms of human exploration, and the concept of traveling there required moderate violations of the real-world laws as understood in that era. The narrative includes fantastical elements and methods of travel that were not possible according to the scientific knowledge of the time.

The poem celebrates his voyage and the broader Portuguese explorations during the Age of Discovery. While the narrative includes mythological elements and divine interventions, the main protagonist, Vasco da Gama, is a real character who existed in history. The poem does not significantly alter his biographical details beyond the typical embellishments found in epic poetry. Therefore, considering the historical context and the worldview of the 16th century, Vasco da Gama's character would be evaluated as real. 

Score=0","""The Lusiads"" by Luís de Camões is an epic poem that primarily recounts the Portuguese voyages of discovery during the Age of Exploration, focusing on Vasco da Gama's journey to India. The work blends historical events with mythological and fantastical elements. 

From the perspective of the 16th-century worldview, the historical events, such as the voyage itself and encounters with various peoples and places, are based on actual occurrences. However, Camões embellishes these events with mythological figures like gods and nymphs, which were not believed to be real by the people of the time but were used as literary devices to enhance the narrative.

Given the historical context, the core events of the voyage are actual historical events with some invented details for dramatic effect. The inclusion of mythological elements would have been seen as a poetic embellishment rather than a literal account. Therefore, the work can be classified as actual historical events with invented details.

However, Camões also incorporates mythological and fantastical elements, such as the Island of Love, which is an invented location. This island, while fantastical, involves minor violations of real-world laws, as it is depicted as a paradise created by the gods for the sailors. Given the historical context of the 16th century, the inclusion of such mythological elements would have been seen as a poetic embellishment rather than a serious geographical claim.

In the context of the 16th century, when the book was written, giants were part of folklore and myth, but they were not considered real or probable beings. The character of Gargantua involves significant exaggeration and fantastical elements that go beyond the natural laws as understood in Rabelais's time. While the existence of giants might have been entertained in myths and legends, the specific characteristics and actions of Gargantua, such as his immense size and feats, require moderate violations of real-world laws. Therefore, considering the historical context and the nature of the character, Gargantua would be assessed as an invented character whose existence is not possible but involves moderate violations of real-world laws. Score=5","""Gargantua"" by François Rabelais is a satirical and comedic work that features exaggerated and fantastical events. The story includes the birth and life of the giant Gargantua, whose size and actions are beyond the realm of possibility according to the natural laws understood in the 16th century. The events in the book, such as Gargantua's enormous appetite, his ability to drink entire rivers, and his interactions with other giants, involve significant violations of real-world laws as understood at the time. While the narrative is set in a recognizable historical context, the events themselves are clearly intended as fantastical and humorous exaggerations, not meant to be taken as plausible or possible within the worldview of the period. Therefore, the work involves extreme violations of real-world laws, placing it at the higher end of the scale. Score=6","""Gargantua"" by François Rabelais is a satirical and fantastical work that features a mix of real and invented locations. The narrative includes real geographical locations in France, such as Paris and the Loire Valley, but it also introduces fictional places like the Abbey of Thélème. The Abbey of Thélème, with its utopian and hedonistic characteristics, represents an invented location that would not be possible in the real world due to its idealized and fantastical nature. However, the existence of such a place involves only minor violations of real-world laws, as it primarily challenges social norms and structures rather than physical laws. Considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the 16th century, the setting of the Abbey of Thélème would be seen as a creative and imaginative construct rather than an extreme impossibility. Therefore, the work can be evaluated as having invented locations whose existence is not possible but involves minor violations of real-world laws. Score=4",5,6,4,15

These characters are invented by Chaucer, but they are representative of real social classes and types of people that existed in 14th-century England.

Some stories, like ""The Knight's Tale,"" involve events that could have occurred in a historical context, such as tournaments and courtly love, though they are fictionalized. Other tales, like ""The Wife of Bath's Tale,"" involve elements of folklore and magic, such as a knight encountering a magical old woman who transforms into a beautiful maiden, which would not be considered possible even by the standards of the time.

This pact and the supernatural elements associated with it, such as the ability to perform magic and the presence of demons, involve moderate violations of real-world laws. During the time Goethe wrote the play, the belief in magic and the supernatural was still present, but the specific events and characters in the play are largely fictionalized beyond what was considered possible. Therefore, the character of Faust in Goethe's work would be assessed as an invented character whose existence is not possible but involves moderate violations of real-world laws. Score=5","""Faust"" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is a dramatic work that involves a pact with the devil, Mephistopheles, and explores themes of ambition, desire, and the quest for knowledge.

In the context of the early 19th century, when Goethe wrote the play, such events were considered possible within the realm of supernatural beliefs and religious teachings, though not probable in everyday reality. The narrative involves elements like magic and supernatural intervention, which would have been seen as possible but not probable by the standards of the time. Therefore, the work involves invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable, but it does not require significant violations of real-world laws as understood in that period.

Since Omar Khayyam was a real person, and the work does not invent biographical details about him but rather presents his philosophical musings, the characters involved are real.

It does not present a narrative of historical events but rather offers reflections and meditations on existence.

Given that the work is not centered around historical events, but rather philosophical musings, it does not fit neatly into the scale provided. The quatrains do not describe specific events that can be evaluated for their historical accuracy or possibility. Instead, they explore timeless human concerns and existential questions.

Therefore, since the work does not involve historical events, invented or otherwise, it is not applicable to the scale designed for evaluating historical narratives.

It does not emphasize specific geographical locations or settings in the way that a narrative or epic might. Instead, the settings are often metaphorical or symbolic, reflecting the inner landscapes of thought and emotion rather than physical places.

Given the historical context of the 12th century, the worldview of the time would not have found any of the settings in the Rubaiyat to be fantastical or impossible.

From the perspective of the historical period in which the book was written (1945), the idea of animals organizing, speaking, and establishing a political system involves a significant departure from real-world laws. While the story is a metaphor for real historical events, the literal events of animals behaving in such a human-like manner are not possible according to the natural laws understood at the time.

The main protagonists, such as Juliana Frink, Frank Frink, and Nobusuke Tagomi, are fictional but are portrayed as ordinary individuals living in a world where the Axis powers won World War II. Their existence is entirely plausible within the novel's alternate historical framework, as they are depicted as regular people navigating the socio-political landscape of this alternate reality. Therefore, the characters do not require any violations of real-world laws for their existence, making them possible within the context of the story's historical period. Score=2","""The Man in the High Castle"" by Philip K. Dick is an alternate history novel that explores a world in which the Axis powers won World War II. The novel presents a scenario where the United States is divided between the Japanese Empire and Nazi Germany. From the perspective of the historical period in which the book was written (1962), the events described are entirely invented and represent a significant departure from actual historical events. The idea of the Axis powers winning the war and the subsequent division of the United States involves a major alteration of known historical outcomes. While the concept of an alternate history is theoretically possible, the specific events and outcomes depicted in the novel are not probable given the actual historical context and outcomes of World War II. Therefore, the work involves invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable. 

Score=3","""The Man in the High Castle"" by Philip K.

The geographical locations themselves, such as San Francisco and New York, are real and recognizable. However, the details of these locations are invented to fit the alternate history scenario. The existence of such a world is possible within the context of the historical period of the 1960s, as it involves a plausible alternate outcome of historical events rather than a violation of real-world laws.

"The Master and Margarita","Mikhail Bulgakov",1967,"Russia","The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov written in 1967","""The Master and Margarita"" by Mikhail Bulgakov features several main protagonists, including the Devil (Woland), Margarita, and the Master. Evaluating these characters based on the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, which is the early 20th century Soviet Union, we find the following:

1. **Woland (the Devil)**: In the context of early 20th-century Soviet Union, the existence of the Devil would be considered impossible, as the prevailing ideology was atheistic and materialistic, rejecting supernatural entities. However, the character involves moderate violations of real-world laws, as he is depicted with supernatural powers but still interacts with the world in a way that maintains some internal logic.

2. **Margarita**: Margarita is a human character who becomes a witch through a pact with Woland. Her existence as a human is possible, but her transformation into a witch involves minor violations of real-world laws, as it requires accepting the supernatural elements introduced by Woland.

3. **The Master**: The Master is a writer, and his existence as a human character is entirely possible within the real-world framework of the time.

Considering the main protagonists, the character of Woland as the Devil requires moderate violations of real-world laws, which is the most significant factor in determining the score. Therefore, the work is best categorized as involving characters whose existence is not possible but involves moderate violations of real-world laws.

Score=5","""The Master and Margarita"" by Mikhail Bulgakov is a complex novel that intertwines various narratives, including a retelling of the biblical story of Pontius Pilate and a fantastical account of the Devil visiting Soviet Moscow. When evaluating the events of the novel according to the specified scale, we must consider the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, which is the early 20th century Soviet Union.

1. The retelling of the biblical story of Pontius Pilate involves actual historical events with invented details, as it is based on the trial and crucifixion of Jesus, a historical figure, but with fictionalized elements. This aspect would be rated as 1.

2. The fantastical elements, such as the Devil (Woland) visiting Moscow, involve events that are not possible and require extreme violations of real-world laws, such as magic and supernatural occurrences. These elements would be rated as 6.

Considering the overall narrative and the significant role of the fantastical elements, the novel primarily involves invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible and requires extreme violations of real-world laws. Therefore, the appropriate score for the work is:

Score=6","""The Master and Margarita"" by Mikhail Bulgakov is a novel that features a blend of real and fantastical settings. The primary real-world setting is Moscow, which is depicted with a high degree of realism, reflecting the socio-political environment of the Soviet Union in the 1930s. However, the novel also includes fantastical elements, such as Satan's visit to Moscow and the surreal events that follow, which introduce invented locations and scenarios.

One of the most notable invented settings is the realm of Woland (Satan) and his retinue, which includes supernatural occurrences and spaces that defy the laws of physics and reality as understood in the 1930s. Additionally, there are scenes set in a fantastical version of ancient Jerusalem, which, while based on a real location, includes supernatural and anachronistic elements that stretch beyond historical and geographical accuracy.

Considering the worldview and beliefs of people in the historical period of the work, the fantastical elements and settings in ""The Master and Margarita"" would be seen as improbable and impossible, involving moderate to extreme violations of real-world laws. The novel's settings blend the real with the fantastical in a way that challenges the boundaries of reality as understood at the time.

"Slaughterhouse-Five","Kurt Vonnegut",1969,"United States","Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut written in 1969","""Slaughterhouse-Five"" by Kurt Vonnegut features the main protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, who is an invented character. Billy is a World War II soldier who becomes ""unstuck in time,"" experiencing moments from his life out of sequence. He also encounters aliens called Tralfamadorians, who perceive time differently and abduct him to their planet. 

From the perspective of the worldview and beliefs of people in 1969, the existence of a character like Billy Pilgrim, who experiences time non-linearly and interacts with extraterrestrial beings, involves moderate violations of real-world laws. While the concept of time travel and alien abduction was popular in science fiction at the time, it was not considered possible according to the scientific understanding of the era. Therefore, Billy Pilgrim's existence as described in the novel would not be possible, but it involves moderate rather than extreme violations of real-world laws.

Score=5","""Slaughterhouse-Five"" by Kurt Vonnegut is a novel that blends historical events with science fiction elements. The work is centered around the actual historical event of the bombing of Dresden during World War II, which is a real and significant event. However, the novel introduces invented elements such as time travel and alien abduction by the Tralfamadorians. 

From the perspective of the historical period in which the novel is set (primarily World War II), the occurrence of time travel and alien abductions would not be considered possible. These elements involve extreme violations of real-world laws as understood both in the 1940s and in 1969 when the book was published. Therefore, while the backdrop of the novel is rooted in actual historical events, the key invented events require a suspension of disbelief that goes beyond minor or moderate violations of real-world laws.

Score=6","""Slaughterhouse-Five"" by Kurt Vonnegut is a novel that features a mix of real and invented locations. The primary real geographical location is Dresden, Germany, during World War II, which is depicted with historical accuracy regarding its existence and the events that took place there. However, the novel also introduces the fictional planet of Tralfamadore, which involves significant imaginative elements.

Tralfamadore is an invented location that requires a moderate to extreme violation of real-world laws, as it involves extraterrestrial life forms with a non-linear perception of time, which is not possible according to our understanding of physics and biology. Given the historical period of the work (1969), the concept of alien planets was within the realm of speculative fiction, but the specific characteristics of Tralfamadore push it beyond probable existence.

Considering the mix of real and fantastical elements, and focusing on the invented location of Tralfamadore, the setting involves moderate violations of real-world laws. Therefore, the appropriate score for the setting in ""Slaughterhouse-Five"" is:

"Ficciones","Jorge Luis Borges",1944,"Argentina","Ficciones by Jorge Luis Borges written in 1944","""Ficciones"" by Jorge Luis Borges is a collection of short stories that often explores complex philosophical themes and metaphysical concepts. The main protagonists in these stories are typically invented characters whose existence involves significant violations of real-world laws. Borges frequently blurs the line between reality and fiction, creating characters that exist in paradoxical or fantastical circumstances. For example, in ""The Library of Babel,"" the characters inhabit a universe that is an infinite library, which is a concept that defies the laws of physics and reality as understood in any historical period. Similarly, in ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,"" the characters are part of a fictional world that begins to intrude upon reality, challenging the very nature of existence and perception. These stories require extreme violations of real-world laws, as they delve into the realms of the impossible and the surreal. Therefore, the protagonists in ""Ficciones"" are best categorized as invented characters whose existence is not possible and requires extreme violations of real-world laws. Score=6","""Ficciones"" by Jorge Luis Borges is a collection of short stories that often explore complex philosophical and metaphysical themes. The stories frequently involve invented historical events, blending reality with fiction in a way that challenges the reader's perception of truth and history. Borges is known for his use of fantastical elements and paradoxes, which often require significant suspension of disbelief.

For example, in ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,"" Borges describes a fictional world with its own unique metaphysics, which eventually begins to influence and alter the real world. This involves a significant departure from real-world laws and historical events, as it suggests the creation of a fictional reality that can impact our own.

Given the nature of Borges' work, which often involves extreme violations of real-world laws and the creation of entirely fictional histories and worlds, the events in ""Ficciones"" would be considered impossible by the standards of the historical period in which they were written. Therefore, the degree of invention and the requirement for extreme violations of real-world laws place this work at the higher end of the scale.

Score=6","""Ficciones"" by Jorge Luis Borges is a collection of short stories that often explore complex philosophical and metaphysical themes through the use of intricate and imaginative settings. Borges is known for creating fictional worlds that challenge the boundaries of reality, often incorporating elements of fantasy and paradox.

In ""Ficciones,"" many of the settings are invented and involve significant violations of real-world laws. For example, in ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,"" Borges describes an entirely fictional world with its own unique metaphysics and languages, which would require extreme violations of real-world laws to exist. The story blurs the line between reality and fiction, suggesting the possibility of a world that operates under entirely different principles from our own.

Given the historical context of the 1940s, when the work was published, the settings in ""Ficciones"" would have been seen as highly imaginative and not possible within the known laws of the universe at the time. Borges's use of invented locations often serves to explore philosophical ideas rather than to create believable worlds.

Therefore, considering the degree of invention and the extreme violations of real-world laws required for these settings to exist, the appropriate score for ""Ficciones"" is:

These include encounters with the Cyclops, Sirens, and the witch-goddess Circe, as well as Odysseus's interactions with gods like Athena and Poseidon.

In the context of the ancient Greek worldview, the existence of gods and mythical creatures was considered plausible, and divine intervention in human affairs was a common belief. However, from a modern perspective, these events involve significant violations of real-world laws, such as the existence of one-eyed giants and transformations of humans into animals.

"The Road","Cormac McCarthy",2006,"United States","The Road by Cormac McCarthy written in 2006","""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy is a post-apocalyptic novel featuring two main protagonists: a father and his young son. These characters are entirely invented by the author, but their existence is possible within the context of the novel's setting. The story is set in a world that has experienced a catastrophic event, but the characters themselves are human and do not possess any supernatural or extraordinary traits that would violate real-world laws. Given the historical period of the work (contemporary to its publication), the existence of such characters is entirely plausible. Therefore, the characters fall into the category of invented characters whose existence would be possible. Score=2","""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy is a post-apocalyptic novel that depicts a world devastated by an unspecified cataclysmic event. The events in the novel revolve around the survival journey of a father and his son through a barren, ash-covered landscape. Given the context of the novel, the catastrophic event and its aftermath are invented historical events. However, the occurrence of such an event is within the realm of possibility, as it could be interpreted as a result of nuclear war, environmental disaster, or other large-scale calamities that are conceivable within the laws of physics and human history. Therefore, the events in the novel would be classified as invented but possible, aligning with the worldview and beliefs of people in the contemporary period of the work's publication. 

Score=2","""The Road"" by Cormac McCarthy is set in a post-apocalyptic world that is a speculative extension of our current reality. The geographical locations in the novel are real, as the story takes place in the United States, but the details of the environment are altered to reflect the aftermath of an unspecified cataclysmic event. This setting involves a world that is bleak, barren, and largely devoid of life, which is a plausible scenario given the context of the narrative. The existence of such a setting is possible within the realm of speculative fiction, as it does not require any violations of real-world laws, only an extension of current possibilities. Therefore, the setting can be classified as real geographical locations with invented details. Score=1",2,2,1,5
"The Hunger Games","Suzanne Collins",2008,"United States","The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins written in 2008","In ""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins, the main protagonist is Katniss Everdeen. She is an invented character whose existence would be possible within the context of the story's setting. The character of Katniss is a human being with no supernatural abilities or characteristics that defy the laws of nature. Her skills, such as archery and survival tactics, are grounded in reality and could be possessed by a person in a dystopian future. The world she inhabits, while fictional, does not require any extreme violations of real-world laws to accept her existence. Therefore, based on the criteria provided and considering the worldview of the contemporary period in which the book was written, Katniss Everdeen would be evaluated as an invented character whose existence is possible. Score=2","""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins is set in a dystopian future where a totalitarian regime, the Capitol, controls the nation of Panem. The story revolves around the annual event known as the Hunger Games, where children from different districts are forced to fight to the death in a televised event. 

From the perspective of the historical period in which the book is set (a speculative future), the events are invented but could be seen as a possible extension of historical trends such as authoritarian control, societal inequality, and the use of media for propaganda. While the specific events of the Hunger Games themselves are fictional, the concept of a society using brutal entertainment as a means of control is not entirely without precedent in human history, albeit in less extreme forms.

Given the speculative nature of the work and its setting in a future that extrapolates from historical and contemporary societal issues, the events are invented but could be considered possible within the context of the story's world. Therefore, the degree of invention aligns with invented historical events whose occurrence would be possible.

Score=2","""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins is set in a dystopian future version of North America, specifically in a nation called Panem. Panem is divided into the Capitol and 12 districts, each with its own distinct characteristics and resources. While the geographical setting is based on a real continent, the specific locations, such as the Capitol and the districts, are invented. The existence of such a nation is possible within the context of a future society, given the historical and political changes that could lead to such a division. The setting involves a plausible reimagining of geographical and political boundaries, without requiring violations of real-world laws. Therefore, the setting falls under the category of invented locations whose existence would be possible. Score=2",2,2,2,6
