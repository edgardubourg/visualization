"The Bible","Various",100,"Middle East","The Bible by Various written in 100","Evaluating ""The Bible"" based on the specified referent involves considering the main protagonists, such as figures like Adam and Eve, Noah, Moses, Jesus, and others. These characters are central to the narratives within the Bible and are often considered to have varying degrees of historical and theological significance.

1. **Adam and Eve**: According to the beliefs of people in the historical context of the Bible, Adam and Eve were considered real individuals, the first humans created by God. However, from a modern anthropological perspective, their existence is not probable as literal historical figures due to the allegorical nature of their story.

2. **Noah**: Noah is another character whose existence is debated. While the story of the flood is a significant narrative, the historical and archaeological evidence for a global flood and a single individual like Noah is not probable.

3. **Moses**: Moses is a central figure in the Hebrew Bible, and while there is some historical debate about his existence, he is often considered a probable historical figure, though the details of his life as described in the Bible may be embellished.

4. **Jesus**: Jesus is a historical figure whose existence is widely accepted by historians, though the miraculous aspects of his life as described in the Bible are matters of faith rather than historical fact.

Given the historical context of the Bible and the beliefs of the people at the time, many of these characters were considered real or probable. However, from a modern perspective, some characters and their stories involve elements that are not probable or possible without significant violations of natural laws.

Considering the blend of historical figures and allegorical or miraculous elements, the evaluation leans towards invented characters whose existence is not probable due to the supernatural aspects of their stories.

Score=3","Evaluating ""The Bible"" based on the specified referent involves considering the historical context and the beliefs of people during the time it was written and compiled. The Bible is a collection of texts that includes a wide range of genres, such as historical narratives, poetry, prophecy, and parables. 

1. **Actual Historical Events**: Some parts of the Bible, particularly certain historical books, describe events that align with known historical facts, such as the existence of certain ancient cities and empires. However, the details and interpretations of these events often include theological perspectives and miraculous occurrences.

2. **Invented Historical Events with Invented Details**: Many events in the Bible, such as the Exodus or the reigns of certain kings, are debated among historians regarding their historical accuracy. While some elements may be based on real events, the details are often embellished or interpreted through a religious lens.

3. **Invented Historical Events Whose Occurrence is Not Probable**: Certain events, like the global flood described in the story of Noah, are considered improbable by modern historical and scientific standards, though they were likely seen as plausible by ancient audiences.

4. **Invented Historical Events Whose Occurrence is Not Possible**: Miraculous events, such as the parting of the Red Sea or the resurrection of Jesus, require violations of natural laws. These events are central to the religious beliefs of the time but are not considered possible by modern scientific understanding.

5. **Invented Historical Events Whose Occurrence is Not Possible Because it Requires Important Violations of the Laws of the Real World**: Some events, like the creation of the world in six days or the talking serpent in the Garden of Eden, involve significant violations of natural laws as understood today.

Considering the beliefs of people in the historical context of the Bible, many of these events were accepted as possible or even factual. However, from a modern perspective, they often require significant suspension of disbelief regarding natural laws.

Score=4","The Bible, a collection of religious texts, contains a mix of real geographical locations and invented or symbolic places. Many of the settings, such as Jerusalem, Egypt, and Babylon, are real geographical locations that were well-known in the historical context of the Bible's composition. However, the Bible also includes places like the Garden of Eden and the Land of Nod, which are more symbolic or mythical in nature. These locations are not possible in the real world as they often involve elements that require violations of natural laws or are purely allegorical. Given the historical context, people of the time might have believed in the existence of some of these places, but from a modern perspective, they are considered mythical. Therefore, the Bible's settings range from real to mythical, with some requiring significant suspension of natural laws. Score=5",3,4,5,12

While Gilgamesh may have been based on a real historical figure, the epic's portrayal of his life involves significant mythological embellishments that go beyond plausible historical biography. In the context of the time, the blending of historical and mythological elements was common, but the existence of characters like Enkidu and the fantastical events described are not probable.

Harari discusses real characters, such as early humans and their evolutionary ancestors, with a focus on factual historical and scientific details. While the book does include some speculative elements about the future and the nature of human societies, the main focus remains on real characters and events grounded in historical and scientific research. Therefore, the work should be evaluated as having real characters. 

Score=0","""Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind"" by Yuval Noah Harari is a non-fiction work that explores the history of Homo sapiens from the emergence of archaic human species to the present. The book is grounded in actual historical and scientific research, presenting a synthesis of anthropology, biology, history, and sociology. Harari discusses real historical events and phenomena, such as the Cognitive Revolution, the Agricultural Revolution, and the Industrial Revolution, while also speculating on future possibilities based on current trends.

The work primarily deals with actual historical events and scientific theories, though Harari does include some speculative elements about the future and the implications of current scientific advancements. However, these speculations are not the focus of the historical narrative and are presented as informed hypotheses rather than invented events.

Given that the book is based on actual historical events with some interpretation and speculation, it fits best under the category of ""Actual historical events with invented details"" due to the interpretative nature of some of Harari's arguments and the speculative future scenarios.

These characters are invented, but their existence is probable within the context of the real world, as they are based on professions and scenarios that could feasibly occur. The films do not require any significant violations of the laws of the real world for the main protagonists to exist. Therefore, the characters fall into the category of invented characters whose existence is probable. Score=2","The ""Shark Attack"" film series, starting with the first film directed by Bob Misiorowski in 1999, primarily revolves around the premise of aggressive and often mutated sharks attacking humans. While shark attacks are real historical events, the series often exaggerates these occurrences with elements such as genetically altered sharks or sharks behaving in ways that are not typical of their natural behavior. 

In the context of the late 1990s, the understanding of sharks and their behavior was well-established, and the idea of genetically modified sharks or sharks with exaggerated aggression would have been seen as improbable. However, the concept of shark attacks themselves is rooted in reality, albeit not to the extent or with the fantastical elements presented in the films.

Given that the series takes a real phenomenon and adds improbable elements, such as genetic mutations leading to extreme behavior, the events can be classified as invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable. 

Score=3","The ""Shark Attack"" film series, starting with the first film directed by Bob Misiorowski in 1999, primarily takes place in real-world settings, such as coastal towns and oceanic environments.

Beatrice, while based on a real person, is portrayed in a highly idealized and allegorical manner. The journey through the afterlife involves interactions with numerous historical, mythological, and allegorical figures, which requires a suspension of disbelief and involves elements that are not possible according to the laws of the real world.

In the context of the 14th century, the events described in ""The Divine Comedy"" are based on theological and cosmological views of the time, which included a belief in the existence of an afterlife and the possibility of divine judgment. However, the specific journey through these realms, the detailed descriptions of the circles of Hell, the terraces of Purgatory, and the spheres of Heaven, as well as the interactions with historical and mythological figures, are products of Dante's imagination and allegorical storytelling.

While the concept of an afterlife was a widely accepted belief, the specific events and structure of the afterlife as depicted by Dante are not based on actual historical events or experiences. They are imaginative constructs that serve as allegories for moral and spiritual lessons.

However, the specific events and characters in Malory's work, such as the Knights of the Round Table, the quest for the Holy Grail, and the magical elements involving Merlin and Excalibur, are largely fictional and rooted in medieval romance traditions.

From a historical perspective, while there may have been a real figure who inspired the legend of King Arthur, the events depicted in ""Le Morte d’Arthur"" are not grounded in verifiable historical fact. The narrative includes elements that are improbable and often impossible, such as magical occurrences and mythical creatures, which would not align with the historical understanding of the 15th century.

However, it also features invented places like Camelot and Avalon, which are central to the Arthurian mythos.

In the historical context of the 15th century, the existence of Camelot and Avalon might have been considered plausible by some due to the blending of myth and history in medieval literature. However, these locations are ultimately fictional and do not correspond to any real places. They are part of a legendary past that combines historical elements with mythological and fantastical ones.

Key events in the novel include characters living for over a century, ghosts interacting with the living, and a rain that lasts for nearly five years. These elements are not possible within the constraints of the real world and require significant suspension of disbelief. The magical realism style allows for these fantastical occurrences to be woven seamlessly into the narrative, reflecting the cultural and historical context of Latin America, where folklore and myth often intersect with reality.

Given the presence of these fantastical elements that violate the laws of the real world, the work should be evaluated as containing invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible because it requires important violations of the laws of the real world.

Score=5","""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" by Gabriel García Márquez is set in the fictional town of Macondo, which is a central location in the novel. Macondo is an invented location, but it is heavily inspired by real geographical settings in Colombia, particularly the Caribbean coast where García Márquez grew up. The town is depicted with a blend of magical realism, where extraordinary events occur alongside the mundane, reflecting the cultural and historical context of Latin America. 

While Macondo itself is fictional, its existence is probable within the context of the novel, as it mirrors the characteristics of small towns in Colombia during the time period. The magical elements, such as the rain of yellow flowers or the insomnia plague, are fantastical but are part of the narrative style rather than the geographical setting itself. Therefore, the setting of Macondo can be seen as an invented location whose existence is probable, given the cultural and historical context of the work.

The main protagonist is a fictionalized version of Cyrano himself, who embarks on a fantastical journey to the moon. In the context of the 17th century, the idea of traveling to the moon was purely speculative and involved significant violations of the known laws of physics and astronomy at the time. The protagonist's journey includes encounters with lunar inhabitants and other fantastical elements that were not possible according to the scientific understanding of the era. Therefore, the characters and their experiences are invented and require important violations of the laws of the real world as understood in the historical context of the work. Score=5","""Voyage dans la lune"" by Cyrano de Bergerac, written in the 17th century, is a work of proto-science fiction that describes a journey to the moon. In the context of the time, the idea of traveling to the moon was purely speculative and involved imaginative methods that defied the scientific understanding of the era. For instance, Cyrano's protagonist uses fantastical means such as bottles of dew to ascend to the moon, which clearly violates the known laws of physics and aerodynamics of the 17th century. Given the historical context, such a journey was not considered possible, as it required significant violations of the real world's laws as understood at the time.

The locations described in the work are entirely invented and involve fantastical elements, such as lunar inhabitants and advanced technologies, which were beyond the scientific understanding of the era. The existence of such locations would require significant violations of the laws of the real world as understood in the 17th century, such as the ability to travel through space and survive on the Moon.

The work is set during the Age of Discovery, a period when European explorers were expanding their knowledge of the world. Vasco da Gama was a real person, and his journey is a historical event. However, Camões embellishes the narrative with mythological elements and divine interventions, which were common literary devices in epic poetry of that era. Despite these embellishments, the main protagonist, Vasco da Gama, is a real character, and the core of his story is based on historical events. Therefore, according to the scale, the work should be evaluated as having real characters with some invented biographical details to enhance the narrative. Score=1","""The Lusiads"" by Luís de Camões is an epic poem that primarily recounts the Portuguese explorations during the Age of Discovery, focusing on Vasco da Gama's voyage to India. The poem blends actual historical events with mythological and fantastical elements. 

The core narrative of Vasco da Gama's journey is based on real historical events, as he did indeed lead a successful expedition to India, which was a significant achievement in the late 15th century. However, Camões embellishes this historical account with numerous mythological and fantastical elements, such as the intervention of gods and goddesses from Greco-Roman mythology, which were not part of the actual historical events. 

In the context of the 16th century, while the voyage itself was a real and significant historical event, the inclusion of mythological figures and divine interventions would have been understood as fictional embellishments. These elements are not probable in the real world, as they involve supernatural occurrences that do not align with historical reality.

Therefore, considering the blend of historical fact with mythological fiction, the work can be evaluated as invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable due to the mythological aspects. 

Score=3","""The Lusiads"" by Luís de Camões is an epic poem that primarily recounts the voyages of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama as he discovers a sea route to India. The settings in the poem include real geographical locations such as Lisbon, the Cape of Good Hope, and Calicut, which are described with a mix of historical accuracy and poetic embellishment. Additionally, the poem includes mythological elements, such as the Island of Love, which is an invented location that serves as a fantastical reward for the sailors. 

Considering the historical context of the 16th century, the real locations are described with some invented details, and the mythological elements reflect the Renaissance blending of classical mythology with exploration narratives. The invented locations like the Island of Love require a suspension of disbelief and are not probable within the real world, but they do not require significant violations of the laws of nature as understood at the time.

Therefore, the work includes both real geographical locations with invented details and invented locations whose existence is not probable.

The character of Gargantua is entirely invented and is a product of Rabelais' imagination, drawing on folklore and mythological traditions. In the historical context of the 16th century, the existence of giants like Gargantua was not considered probable, as they require significant violations of the natural laws understood at the time. The character's exaggerated size and abilities place him firmly in the realm of fantasy and satire, rather than any plausible reality. Therefore, Gargantua's existence is not possible because it requires some violations of the laws of the real world. Score=4","""Gargantua"" by François Rabelais is a satirical and comedic work that features the life and adventures of the giant Gargantua. The narrative includes exaggerated and fantastical events, such as Gargantua's miraculous birth, his enormous appetite, and his incredible feats of strength and size. These elements are clearly fictional and are intended to entertain and satirize aspects of society, education, and religion during Rabelais's time.

Given the historical context of the 16th century, people would have understood these events as purely fictional and humorous, rather than probable or possible occurrences. The story involves significant exaggerations and fantastical elements that violate the natural laws of the real world, such as the existence of giants and their extraordinary capabilities.

Therefore, the events in ""Gargantua"" are invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible because they require important violations of the laws of the real world. 

Score=5","""Gargantua"" by François Rabelais is a satirical and comedic work that features a mix of real and invented locations.

For example, the Abbey of Thélème is an invented location that embodies Rabelais' utopian ideals, and its existence is not probable within the real world. However, the setting does not require significant violations of the laws of the real world, as it is more of a satirical and allegorical construct rather than a place that defies physical laws. Considering the historical context of the 16th century, the blend of real and fantastical elements would have been understood as a form of satire and allegory rather than a literal depiction of geography.

Some stories are based on folklore, legends, or moral tales, while others are more fantastical or allegorical in nature. Given the historical context of the work, the pilgrimage and the social interactions among the pilgrims are plausible, but the individual tales often contain invented events that range from probable to improbable. However, none of the tales require violations of the laws of the real world as understood in the 14th century.

Faust is a scholar who makes a pact with Mephistopheles, a demon, to gain unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures. While the character of Faust is based on the historical figure Johann Georg Faust, a German alchemist and magician, Goethe's portrayal involves supernatural elements that go beyond the realm of historical probability. The inclusion of a demon and the pact with the devil are elements that require a suspension of belief in the natural laws of the real world, as understood in the early 19th century. However, these elements do not require significant violations of the laws of the real world, as they are more aligned with folklore and myth rather than outright impossibilities. Therefore, the character of Faust in Goethe's work is best categorized as an invented character whose existence is not probable. Score=3","""Faust"" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is a classic work of literature that blends elements of legend, folklore, and philosophy. The central narrative revolves around the character of Faust, a scholar who makes a pact with the devil, Mephistopheles, in exchange for unlimited knowledge and worldly pleasures. 

In evaluating the events of ""Faust"" based on the specified referent scale:

1. The character of Faust is inspired by the historical figure Johann Georg Faust, a German alchemist, astrologer, and magician who lived in the early 16th century. However, the events in Goethe's ""Faust"" are largely fictionalized and dramatized beyond any historical account of the real Faust's life.

2. The pact with the devil and the supernatural elements, such as Mephistopheles' interventions and the magical transformations, are clearly invented and not based on actual historical events. 

3. The occurrence of such events, involving direct interactions with a devil figure and the supernatural, is not probable within the understanding and beliefs of people in the historical context of the early 19th century. While belief in the supernatural was more prevalent at the time, the specific events in ""Faust"" are fantastical.

4. The narrative requires violations of the laws of the real world, such as the existence of a literal devil who can make pacts and perform magic, which are not possible according to the scientific understanding of the time.

Given these considerations, the events in ""Faust"" are best categorized as invented historical events whose occurrence is not possible because they require some violations of the laws of the real world.

These settings are not entirely invented but are based on folklore and myth, which were part of the cultural understanding of the time. Therefore, while the geographical locations are real, the details and events that occur in these settings involve some degree of invention and mythological embellishment.

Omar Khayyam was a real historical figure, known for his contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and poetry. The quatrains are often interpreted as reflections of his philosophical musings, and while they may contain some poetic embellishments, they do not invent a character beyond the historical Omar Khayyam himself. Therefore, the work involves real characters with potentially invented biographical details or philosophical reflections.

It does not narrate historical events but rather reflects on existential and metaphysical ideas. Therefore, the work does not contain historical events, invented or otherwise, that can be evaluated on the specified scale. The quatrains are more concerned with timeless philosophical musings than with recounting historical occurrences. 

Score=NA","""The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam"" is a collection of quatrains attributed to the Persian mathematician and poet Omar Khayyam. The work is primarily philosophical and reflective, focusing on themes such as the nature of life, fate, and the passage of time.

When geographical references are made, they are typically to real places within the Persian Empire, such as Nishapur, where Khayyam lived, or other known locations in the Islamic world of the 11th and 12th centuries.

Given the historical context, the settings in ""The Rubaiyat"" are based on real geographical locations with some poetic and philosophical embellishments. These embellishments do not invent new locations but rather enhance the existing ones with metaphorical significance. Therefore, the work fits the category of real geographical locations with invented details.

Score=2","""The Iliad"" by Homer is an epic poem that recounts the events of the Trojan War, a legendary conflict between the Greeks and the city of Troy. The work is based on a blend of historical elements and mythological embellishments. 

1. **Historical Basis**: There is some archaeological evidence suggesting that a city resembling Troy existed and may have been involved in conflicts during the Late Bronze Age. However, the specific events and characters described in ""The Iliad"" are largely mythological.

2. **Mythological Elements**: The poem includes numerous interventions by gods and goddesses, which are central to the narrative. These divine interventions and the portrayal of heroes with superhuman abilities are not possible according to the laws of the real world.

3. **Cultural Context**: In the historical context of ancient Greece, the belief in gods and their involvement in human affairs was widespread. Thus, while the events are not possible by modern standards, they were conceivable within the mythological framework of the time.

The story features animals that overthrow their human farmer and attempt to establish an egalitarian society, only to see it devolve into a dictatorship under the pigs.

In evaluating the events of ""Animal Farm,"" we must consider the anthropomorphic portrayal of animals engaging in human-like political activities. While the story is a clear allegory for real historical events, the literal events depicted—such as animals organizing a rebellion, speaking, and forming a government—are not possible within the laws of the real world.

The journey itself, along with the characters and places Christian encounters, such as the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, and the Celestial City, are all invented and serve as metaphors for spiritual concepts and struggles.

Given the allegorical nature of the work, the events are not intended to be historical or probable in a literal sense. Instead, they are crafted to convey moral and religious lessons. From the perspective of the 17th-century audience, these events are understood as symbolic rather than literal occurrences. Therefore, they fall into the category of invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable, as they are not meant to be taken as literal history but as spiritual allegory.

Score=3","""The Pilgrim's Progress"" by John Bunyan is an allegorical work that describes the journey of its protagonist, Christian, from the City of Destruction to the Celestial City. The settings in the book, such as the Slough of Despond, Vanity Fair, and the Celestial City, are entirely invented and serve as symbolic representations of spiritual and moral challenges rather than real geographical locations. 

In the historical context of the 17th century, these locations were understood as allegorical and not intended to be interpreted as real or probable places on Earth. The settings are crafted to convey moral and religious lessons, and their existence is not possible in the real world as they are purely allegorical constructs. 

Given that these locations are invented and their existence is not possible because they require important violations of the laws of the real world (as they are allegorical and not meant to be real), the appropriate score is:

The novel presents a scenario where the United States is divided between the Japanese Empire and Nazi Germany. This premise involves a significant departure from actual historical events, as the Allies won World War II. The occurrence of the Axis powers winning the war is not probable given the actual historical context and outcomes of the war. However, it does not require violations of the laws of the real world, as it is a speculative reimagining of historical events based on different decisions and outcomes.

The geographical locations in the novel, such as the Pacific States of America and the Greater Nazi Reich, are based on real places but are altered to fit the alternate historical scenario. The existence of these locations is not possible in our real world because they require a significant deviation from actual historical events. However, within the context of the novel's alternate history, these locations are presented as plausible outcomes of a different historical trajectory. Given the historical context of the 1960s, the concept of alternate history was a recognized literary device, but the specific geopolitical divisions described in the book are not possible in the real world.

Odysseus himself is portrayed as a human hero, but his adventures involve encounters with mythical creatures and gods, such as the Cyclops Polyphemus, the witch-goddess Circe, and the sea god Poseidon.

From the perspective of ancient Greek beliefs, the existence of gods and mythical creatures was considered possible and even probable, as they were integral to the cultural and religious worldview of the time. However, from a modern standpoint, these elements require significant violations of the laws of the real world. Given the historical context, Odysseus as a human character could be seen as probable, but his interactions with divine and mythical beings push the narrative into the realm of improbability by today's standards.

These elements reflect the beliefs and mythological understanding of ancient Greek society, where interactions with gods and mythical creatures were considered possible within their cultural and religious framework. However, from a modern perspective, these events require significant violations of the laws of the real world, such as the existence of mythical creatures and divine interventions.

Given the historical context of the work and the nature of the events described, the degree of invention and the improbability of these events occurring in the real world, even by ancient Greek standards, would place ""The Odyssey"" at a level where the events are not possible because they require important violations of the laws of the real world.

2. Invented locations with probable existence: Some locations, like the island of the Phaeacians, could be based on real places but are embellished with fictional details.

3. Invented locations whose existence is not probable: The poem includes fantastical places like the land of the Cyclopes and the island of Circe, which are not grounded in reality but could be imagined as possible by the ancient Greeks.

4. Invented locations whose existence is not possible: The Underworld and the island of the Sirens involve supernatural elements that violate the natural laws as understood in the historical context of the work.

Given the blend of real and fantastical elements, and considering the beliefs of the ancient Greeks, the settings in ""The Odyssey"" would likely be seen as a mix of real and mythical, with some locations requiring significant suspension of disbelief.

In evaluating the events of ""Hamlet,"" we must consider the historical context of the early 17th century. The play is set in a fictionalized version of Denmark and involves a ghost, which was a common element in Elizabethan drama and was often accepted by audiences of the time as a plausible narrative device. The political intrigue and royal succession issues are grounded in historical possibilities, as such events were not uncommon in European courts. However, the presence of the ghost and the supernatural elements, while accepted by contemporary audiences, are not events that could occur in the real world according to modern understanding.

Given the historical context of the work and the beliefs of people at the time, the events in ""Hamlet"" would be seen as invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable due to the supernatural elements, but they do not require significant violations of the laws of the real world as understood in the early 1600s.

The setting does not involve any invented locations or require any violations of the laws of the real world.

However, the central plot involving the vengeful pursuit of a singular, almost mythic whale, and the anthropomorphized portrayal of Moby Dick as a creature with near-supernatural attributes, leans into the realm of fiction.

"The Hunger Games","Suzanne Collins",2008,"United States","The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins written in 2008","""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins is set in a dystopian future where the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, participates in a televised event where children fight to the death. The characters, including Katniss, are entirely invented, and their existence is not probable in the real world. The setting and societal structure of Panem, where the story takes place, are fictional and involve a level of societal control and technological advancement that, while imaginative, do not require violations of the laws of the real world. The characters themselves, as human beings, are possible, but their specific circumstances and the world they inhabit are not probable. Therefore, the characters fall into the category of invented characters whose existence is not probable. Score=3","""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins is set in a dystopian future where the nation of Panem has risen from the ruins of what was once North America. The central event of the story is the annual Hunger Games, a televised event where children are selected to fight to the death as a form of entertainment and control by the ruling Capitol.

From an anthropological perspective, the concept of a society using ritualized combat or sacrifice as a means of social control is not entirely without precedent in human history. However, the specific details of the Hunger Games, such as the advanced technology used to manipulate the environment and the highly structured nature of the event, are inventions that do not have a direct historical counterpart.

Given the historical context of the work, the idea of a future society engaging in such practices is a speculative extrapolation rather than a probable historical event. The technological and societal elements depicted in the book, while imaginative, do not violate the fundamental laws of the real world but are rather an extension of current trends taken to an extreme.

Therefore, the events in ""The Hunger Games"" are best categorized as invented historical events whose occurrence is not probable, but they do not require violations of the laws of the real world.

Score=3","""The Hunger Games"" by Suzanne Collins is set in a dystopian future version of North America, specifically in a nation called Panem.

The existence of such a society, with its extreme social structure and the annual event of the Hunger Games, is not probable in the real world. However, it does not require violations of the laws of the real world in terms of geography or physics. The setting is a speculative extension of real locations with invented socio-political details. Therefore, based on the scale provided, the setting of ""The Hunger Games"" would be evaluated as:
